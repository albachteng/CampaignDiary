In Mondial, it is considered terrible luck to see a Raven. He is credited with the creation of elves and ruler of The Weald. When the Raven King spreads his dark wings they block out the light of the sun and he can see everywhere at once. Among the human kingdoms, he is more myth than god, a story used to frighten children into obedience. But the Au'vanwa consider him a mad tyrant, usurper of the Horned Queen.
