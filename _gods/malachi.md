The Au'vanwa say that in the Disparian religion, one does not pray: one studies. The bylaw of worshippers of Malachi is "whatever is necessary." Before he ascended to the godhead, Malachi was a legendary swordsman, wielding an equally legendary silvery greatsword, which he is frequently depicted holding point down before him. But perhaps his greater accomplishment in life was his reputation for winning battles and armies without ever raising his blade. In Disparia, the highest military rank is not General, but Grandmaster. In Malachi, Disparians have a dispassionate and calculating model for war - a tactician, not a beserker.
