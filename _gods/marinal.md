The Marinese worship Marina, their canonical founder. She is known to them as Our Lady of Storm and Sea. Her child is identified only as "The Moon", who she is said to have sacrificed to hold the oceans at bay. Her worshp also seems to be related to the four winds: Borean, Eureon, Notheon, Zephyron. Place names in Marina frequently reference these winds as lesser deities.
<br><br>Marina is lord of the limitless sea, and is believed to hold domain over the rains and waters aross Mondial as well. She is sometimes portrayed as a mother, but her primary role in the pantheon is as a warrior. She is also called "Marinal the Dancer"; the moniker is ironic and refers to her legendaryily wild performance on the battlefields during the War of Lights, the mythical war of Mondial's creation.
<br><br>While Malorn and Malachi are professed to have been born mortal and ascended to the godhead, Marinal is said to have always been master of her domain. She is said to have the power to wash this world away.
