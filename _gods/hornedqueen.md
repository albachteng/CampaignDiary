The Au'vanwa still hold The Horned Queen in their hearts, said to be the original god of The Weald. She is credited with the creation of dragons, minotaurs and dragonborn. Au'vanwa legends say that she gave birth to her own husband, the Raven King, who now rules in her stead. No known depictions of her exist, and while the desert nomads hold her in high esteem, they do not worship her.
