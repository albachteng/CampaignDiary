The adventurers have seen depictions of this unnamed god in the Circle of Illusion, the Great Forest and in the Deep Roads, frequently accompanied by sacrificial offerings. It is a figure shaped like a man but buried under robes. Its face is covered by a mask fashioned in the likeness of a serenely smiling sun. Hubert discovered that the form underneath the robes is not human - it is something misshapen.
