We are not from Marina, we of the Auâ€™vanwa are a desert-dwelling people, but we are not from Mondial either. We call this place the Mundane Lands."

        <image class="character" src="resources/images/AuVanwa Elf.jpg"></image>
    </div>
    <p>The generous and kindhearted leader of a caravan of Au'vanwa, and the
        first living soul our party encountered in Mondial. The caravan he leads
        was seeking work as mercenaries in Chain's End, but were turned away due 
        to an unknown plague. The nomadic elf shared his fire, his wine, as well 
        as his knowledge of the Artifacts and The War of the Lights.

<h2>Duke Geoffrey Belmont</h2>
<p>The jovial and rotund Duke of Redwater, although he spends more time in Chain's End dealing with the King and parliament. Still, the people of Redwater love him and call him "The Good Duke Geoffrey, Blessing of the Four Winds upon him!" Shortly after meeting the party (and imprisoning them on the word of his Steward, Anders) Geoffrey was the target of an assassination attempt by unknown forces. Subsequently, he revealed to his adventurous saviors that he was once a member of the Knights of Marina, a clandestine group of warriors in service of the King. Now he has another job for the adventurers: find out who tried to have him killed, and why. And so the party sets off for Lundis and the Great Forest.</p>
<h2>Anders</h2>
<p>The cold and calculating Steward of Redwater. He serves at the pleasure of
    the Good Duke Geoffrey, brother to the King. Anders hired the party to find
    and eliminate those responsible for attacks on trade caravans along the East
    Road towards Balnying. Upon their return, he insists that the mercenaries lie
    about the cause of the attacks, blaming everything on Disparia. When the party hesitated,
    he had them imprisoned. It quickly becomes apparent that he is not who he seems, as the party 
    learns of his involvement in a plot to assassinate the Duke Geoffrey and place blame on 
    Disparians. Before the party could learn more about his motives, they found him dead in the very same cell in which he had
    imprisoned them.

<h2>Ora</h2>
<p>Ora was a mage of The Circle of Illusion, but she ran away for unknown reasons. 
    She describes life in The Circles as dangerous and oppressive, and she has deep
    scars to prove it. She aided the party in their search for the creatures attacking
    Redwater's caravans before vanishing from her home.

                        Her child is identified only as "The Moon". Her worshp also seems to be related to the four winds:
