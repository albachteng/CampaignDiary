                    <p>Beldryn changed his last name to Bronzeheart after joining the Bronze Bank 
                        of Filia to hide his shame: he was ousted from the Iron Halls for a foolhardy 
                        ploy in the War of the Golden Mountains. Seeking to force a quick end to the war, 
                        he gambled with the lives of an entire battalion under his command throwing them 
                        in full force against the advancing enemy, but was outsmarted by the Goblins of 
                        the nearby Iron Hills. Almost none survived the battle, although the dwarves did 
                        eventually win the war. His true name is Beldryn Runeguard, making him the heir 
                        to a long line of decorated Kingsguard.  </p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Lem to his companions, this sneaky goblin hails from the Iron Hills. He exhibits an insatiable curiosity and fondness for tinkering with potions and equipment - the more explosive, the better. Sly and perceptive, he gets the party out of trouble almost as quick as he can get them into trouble. The rogue has proven himself particularly convincing and charming when it comes to sniffing out work for the party, and talking his way out of difficult situations, often with an assumed dialect.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Rawson Titanwound's background, before joining the mercenaries of the Bronze Vault of Filia, was as a hunter of beasts. He took a particular speciality in lycanthropy, and therefore styles himself as a Werewolf Hunter. His skills with beasts have already helped the party out of dire situations, as it turns out there are beasts aplenty in Mondial. Generally seeing himself as the voice of reason in the party, his contributions have more often than not gently nudged the party down a safer path. </p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Isho hails from the sands beyond the Golden Hills, making him a foreigner among foreigners in the party. A member of a nomadic tribe, he was raised as a Sun Warrior, like his father before him and his grandmother before that. He carries with him a small amount of desert sands, which serves as an oracle for ritual divination, and wields the distinctive yari swordspear of his people. Isho is a stalwart warrior, often rushing to the front of the group to serve as the party's bulwark. He speaks Common slowly and carefully, unfamiliar as he is with the language, and he often finds the lifestyle of city dwellers confusing, but his strong moral character makes him the heart and conscience of the party.</p>

                    <p>The party knew little of his kind before arriving in Mondial, but Ulrach of the Au'vanwa quickly demonstrated that his kind are trustworthy, serious and capable warriors. His tribe instilled in him a powerful distrust of arcane artifacts and The Art, but with Chain's End closed and his tribe desperate for resources, he agrees to join the adventurers to investigate the practices of Lundis and The Circle of Illusion within the forests he was taught to avoid for the good of his tribe.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>The generous and kindhearted leader of a caravan of Au'vanwa, and the
                        first living soul our party encountered in Mondial. The caravan he leads
                        was seeking work as mercenaries in Chain's End, but were turned away due 
                        to an unknown plague. The nomadic elf shared his fire, his wine, as well 
                        as his knowledge of the Artifacts and The War of the Lights.

                <h4>Duke Geoffrey Belmont</h4>
                <p>The jovial and rotund Duke of Redwater, although he spends more time in Chain's End dealing with the King and parliament. Still, the people of Redwater love him and call him "The Good Duke Geoffrey, Blessing of the Four Winds upon him!" Shortly after meeting the party (and imprisoning them on the word of his Steward, Anders) Geoffrey was the target of an assassination attempt by unknown forces. Subsequently, he revealed to his adventurous saviors that he was once a member of the Knights of Marina, a clandestine group of warriors in service of the King. Now he has another job for the adventurers: find out who tried to have him killed, and why. And so the party sets off for Lundis and the Great Forest.</p>
                <h4>Anders</h4>
                <p>The cold and calculating Steward of Redwater. He serves at the pleasure of
                    the Good Duke Geoffrey, brother to the King. Anders hired the party to find
                    and eliminate those responsible for attacks on trade caravans along the East
                    Road towards Balnying. Upon their return, he insists that the mercenaries lie
                    about the cause of the attacks, blaming everything on Disparia. When the party hesitated,
                    he had them imprisoned. It quickly becomes apparent that he is not who he seems, as the party 
                    learns of his involvement in a plot to assassinate the Duke Geoffrey and place blame on 
                    Disparians. Before the party could learn more about his motives, they found him dead in the very same cell in which he had
                    imprisoned them.

                <h4>Ora</h4>
                <p>Ora was a mage of The Circle of Illusion, but she ran away for unknown reasons. 
                    She describes life in The Circles as dangerous and oppressive, and she has deep
                    scars to prove it. She aided the party in their search for the creatures attacking
                    Redwater's caravans before vanishing from her home.

                <h2>Locations</h2>
                <h3>Kingdoms and Cities</h3>
                <h4>Marina</h4>
                    <p>Canonically founded by the Goddess of Storm and Sea Marinal, 
                        the people of Marina are a sea-faring sort, although they readily
                        admit that they do not venture far from the sight of shore - those who
                        do are rarely seen again. Marina's dominance of the waters has led to 
                        conflict with Disparia in the past. Regardless, they are an overwhelmingly
                        pastoral kingdom, with broad swathes of land dedicated to agriculture. Marina
                        was the first and currently only kingdom to make trade with the Goblins for
                        their smokepowder weapons.
                    </p>
                <h5>Chain's End</h5>
                    <p>The capitol city of the Kingdom of Marina, Chain's End sits over the 
                        mouth of the River Llewellyn's Chain ("The Chain"). It is the seat of
                        nobility and the largest city in Mondial. Talpa Adamina informs the party
                        that it is currently in lock-down due to an unknown plague. 
                    </p>
                <h5>Redwater</h5>
                    <p>Sitting at the top of the peninsula known as Marinal's Call, Redwater is ideally situated to observe
                        any potential invasions by sea. Even enemy ships seeking to surprise Marina
                        from Disparia would have to stick close to shore and would therefore need to
                        take a long route around the Call. It is a well-fortified town of modest size. 
                        It takes its name from the last war with Disparia, where its walls marked the high-water 
                        mark of the Disparian advance. 
                    </p>
                <image src="resources/images/Redwater.png"></image>
                <h5>Balnying</h5>
                    <p>"Goblin Town" to those who can't bother to pronounce it. Its name means "Gift of Fire" 
                        and it is known as the largest settlement of the otherwise underground-dwelling people 
                        called Goblins. It is most-well known for being regularly burnt to the groun by the
                        eccentric experiments of its populace, who are devout tinkers. Redwater residents tell
                        the party that Knights have been dispatched from Chain's End to keep an eye on the continued
                        development of dangerous weaponry. 
                    </p>
                <h4>Disparia</h4>
                    <p>Friends to none, the Disparians are known to be militant and fiercely protective. Their
                        proximity to the desert leads to regular conflict with the Au'vanwa nomads that dwell there. 
                        Disparia invaded Marina in generations past, but Marina held the line, ultimately ceding 
                        the Bay of Fire to the Disparian King. 
                    </p>
                <h5>Malachi's Watch</h5>
                    <p>The Capitol of Disparia, known as The City of Locked Doors. Its residents are 
                        staunchly opposed to allowing outsiders within its walls, and fiercely anti-magic.
                    </p>
                <h4>Lundis</h4>
                    <p>Smallest of the human Kingdoms, the city is protected primarily by its location: deep 
                        in the enchanted and beast-filled forests at the center of Mondial, where few dare to 
                        travel. Its proximity to The Circle of Illusion has led to the general belief that they 
                        are the most sympathetic to the practice of magic. Their major export is a variety of 
                        healing potion with a bioluminescent glow. The party learns from Talpa that their Church
                        claims to have developed a means of preventing the frenzy that comes with the use of Artifacts.
                    </p>
                <h5>White Tower</h5>
                    <p>The mysterious Capitol of Lundis, deep in the illusory forest at the center of Mondial. 
                        Seat of the Church of Lundis, at the head of which sits their King. Canonically founded by Malorn, whose Church is the state religion of Lundis. 
                    </p>
                <h3>Other Locations</h3>
                <h4>Au'vanwa</h4>
                    <p>The name for both the people and their home-in-exile. The Au'vanwa consider themselves
                        not to be natives of Mondial, despite having lived here for generations. They are a group of elves, minotaurs and dragonborn, collectively 
                        "Lost and Away." Au'vanwa is hidden away in the desert near the Great Rift, far to the north-east. Their
                        people shun the forests for fear of The Voice Within the Trees that calls them back to The Weald, where they believe 
                        the Raven King would seek to control them once more.</p>
                <h4>The Circle of Illusion</h4>
                        <p>Across the River Llewellyn's Chain, in the great forests at Mondial's center, is a loose 
                            confederacy of Mages. Spurned from the human kingdoms for their magical talents, the mages ban together
                            for safety. Ora tells the party that it is a terrible place that brought more questions than answers. 
                            Of course, nothing in the Circle of Illusion is what it seems. Who knows to what ends they practice their charms?
                        </p>
                <h4>The School of Talen</h4>
                        <p>Known only to the Outlanders as a place of study, it is a Lundisian operation by the sea far to the west. 
                            The Scholars seek to uncover the truth about the Artifacts - and their use.

                <h3>Religion</h3>
                    <p>The Marinese worship Marina, their canonical founder. She is known to them as Our Lady of Storm and Sea.
                        Her child is identified only as "The Moon". Her worshp also seems to be related to the four winds: 
                        Borean, Eureon, Notheon, Zephyron.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Lundisians worship Malorn, a God of Death. Little is known about their Church, save that it is

                    <h3>Bottom of the Well</h3>
                    <image src="resources/images/Cathedral Ceiling.png"></image>
                    <aside>You descend forty feet down the old well, noting the intricate carvings along its edges, matching them to the Lighthouse at the tip of the peninsula Marinal's Call. At its base is a staircase spiraling even further into the depths. The hall to the south is caved in, but to the north you are met with high, stained-glass windows. As you continue your exploration, the ceiling opens up into a high dome. Reflected in the glass, in frescoes, in statues carved into columns, the cathedral's repeating motif is that of a serenely smiling sun and feathered wings.</aside>
                    <p>The party's investigations topside lead them to Ora, a witch at the edge of the woods a day's journey due north of Redwater. She reveals to the party that she has been hiding from both the Marinese authorities - whose anti-magic sensibilities were on full display in Redwater - as well as the Circle of Illusion, a coalition of mages deep in the forests to the north, past the river <em>Llewellyn's Chain</em>. Her practices have aided the locals to some degree, so they keep her presence a secret.</p>
                    <aside>"For ten years, I have lived here at the edge of the forest. And every night, for ten years, I cast the same spell: I send my awareness out into the nearby forest and detect the other minds as they come and go from my home. For ten years, I have lived in fear that I would detect the Mages of the Circle coming from the North. Ten days ago, I detected something else: empty minds, emerging from deep within the earth."</aside>
                    <p>At the bottom of the old well, the party discovers a sunken cathedral just below the surface of the earth. Its high stained-glass windows face only earth and darkness now. At the east end of the grand hall, the party fights a trio of ghouls and discovers the catacombs of a once-powerful elvish race. To the west, the party finds three statues and a glowing orange lichen. The statues depict a bent humanoid wearing a cracked laughing mask, a chained giant holding a hammer and chisel, and a tall man with a serenly smiling sun for a face.</p>
                    <p>Their investigations are interrupted by the attack of shrouded humanoid figures, firing volleys from darkness, both mundane and magical. Their leader wields a longsword that expands into a bladed whip. Nearing the end of his powers, his flesh erupts in a shower of blood and he transforms into a monstrous, orange-eyed lycanthrope. Although there are some close calls, the party is victorious.</p>
                    <p>At the end of the assault, the party is surprised to discover a pair of allies among the dark figures. Two of the unknown race emerge from the tunnels at the end of the cathedral to kill off their brethren. One tosses a necklace with a moon-shaped pendant to the party and then snaps a staff of power across its knee, giving one longing look past the party to the faint light of the sun gently falling down the well as the sun rises. The broken staff erupts with the power to shatter several of the support columns, and the party flees the collapsing cathedral.</p>

                    <h3>A Garden Party</h3>
                    <image src= "resources/images/Table Mimic.jpg"></image>
                    <p>After being held in the Magistrate's offices for hours, Anders has the party stripped of their weapons and thrown into a cell. Rather than listening to the party's discoveries in the sunken cathedral, Anders insists that Disparia is behind the attacks and that the party are liars (true) and spies (not true). Thanks to Lem's quick thinking, the rogue manages to keep hold of his thieves' tools. But it is the return of the mysterious and furtive Pygmies that saves the party and puts them on the path to save the Duke Geoffrey. Donning magical masks, the party sneaks into a garden party at the Duke's estate.</p>
                    <p>At the party, the group splits up to find their equipment and replace Anders at the card table to keep an eye on the Duke. Ulrach learns of the Duke's disturbed daughter, the Lady Dauphine, who speaks in strange fables. Lem observes strange behavior from some of the guests. Rawson and Isho keep watch for the assassination attempt and discover a strange circle of runes in the attic.</p>
                    <aside>A hush falls over the party-goers. A loud pop and fading whine soars up into the midnight sky. After a moment of silence there is a crackle and a series of multicolored explosions light up the garden, casting long shadows against the Dukeâ€™s Estate. Red, blue, green and yellow fires in the shapes of flowers, shooting stars and glittering suns are painted across the sky as more and more fireworks are launched into the air. The crowd gasps and applauds. For many, it is the first time in their lives that they have seen such a display. A moment later, the screaming begins.

                        The card tables in the dining room shudder. They lift off from the ground and suddenly they are towering over the players. The legs quiver and soften into sludge and the flat tops break apart into a gaping, toothy maw, a long purple tongue and foul, poisonous breath.

                    <p>The party is quick to act, as are Captain Loom of the Marinese army and Ada Dalton, ostensibly tutor to the Lady Dauphine. They defend the Duke, who takes a few hits in spite of their efforts, while the rest of the party focuses down the mimics. Simultaneously, the nearby string quartet rise in unison and the illusion falls away as the party sees that the musicians were truly a single man, a mage, and an Illusionist. After dispatching the massive, poisonous table-mimics, Rawson chases after the mage outside into the fleeing crowd. He grabs the first person he sees and turns them to face him - but finds only a Redwater resident. He tries another - with the same results. With mounting dread, the party realizes that such a mage could be anyone, anywhere - invisible, disguised or spirited away. He is gone.</p>
                    <p>They return, with Captain Loom, to the cell where they left Anders. What they find there is shocking.</p>
                    <aside>A strange gentleman in elegant attire of gold and bright green stands over the bloodied corpse of Anders Willifort, sometime Steward of Redwater. His throat has been slashed as if viciously torn open by teeth and claw. The gentleman is wiping his blood-stained hands on a soft white handkerchief as you approach. His bright eyes give off an eerie, golden light. Stranger still, however, are his horns - the curved horns of a ram. He is not an elf. He is not a minotaur. He is not a dragonborn. He is something in between them all. He smiles in a manner that, were it not for the circumstances, might be entirely disarming. 
                    </aside>
                    <p>The gentleman disappears in a flutter of wings as dozens of ravens screech through the iron bars of Redwater's cells. 
                        <br><br>
                        Invited by Duke Geoffrey and Captain Loom to remain awhile at the Redwater estate, the party now rests, researches and plans their next move. Increasingly, the signs point to Lundis as likely instigator of the assassination and the framing of Disparia. Lundis and the Circle of Illusion have kept to themselves for a hundred years within the Great Forest. And so becomes our adventurer's destination.
