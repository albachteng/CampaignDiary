The Deep Roads have been systematically sealed throughout the human kingdoms. Only the Dwarves of Cloudstone dare make their home among the dark depths. What little the party has seen of The Deep Roads implies a once vast and mighty kingdom and the worship of strange gods - a chained giant, a laughing imp and a serenely smiling sun. The party knows the Drow hide underground, and the Goblins recently emerged from The Deep Roads to make a new home for themselves on the surface in Marina.
