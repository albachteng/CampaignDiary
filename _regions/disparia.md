Friends to none, the Disparians are known to be militant and fiercely protective. Their proximity to the desert leads to regular conflict with the Au'vanwa nomads that dwell there. Disparia invaded Marina in generations past, but Marina held the line, ultimately ceding the Bay of Fire to the Disparian King.

Now Disparia is making war again. It was Disparia, with the apparent help or at least acquiescence of Cloudstone, that obliterated White Tower, and with it the sovereign nation of Lundis. They did so with a terrible power: the party watched dragon riders descend upon the unsuspecting city.
