Little is known of the fae lands beyond Malorn's veil. It is said the separation between the twilight realms of The Weald and the mundane lands of Mondial is thinnest within the Great Forest. Legend tells of a wicked and terrifing Raven King holding court over a gloaming court of faeries and beasts. The Au'vanwa tell tales of a once beautiful and kind Horned Queen that ruled there, but shun the forests for fear of the whispers in the trees that drive travelers mad. If The Weald can hold such power over travelers from beyond the veil, what effects could traveling within the twilight realm itself have?
