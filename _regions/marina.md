Canonically founded by the Goddess of Storm and Sea Marinal, 
the people of Marina are a sea-faring sort, although they readily
admit that they do not venture far from the sight of shore - those who
do are rarely seen again. Marina's dominance of the waters has led to 
conflict with Disparia in the past. Regardless, they are an overwhelmingly
pastoral kingdom, with broad swathes of land dedicated to agriculture. Marina
was the first and currently only kingdom to make trade with the Goblins for
their smokepowder weapons.<br><br>The party has been hired several times by the Marinese nobility and have gained quite a reputation among them. Duke Goeffrey in particular places great faith in the adventurers.
