A castle seeming to float on the water just off-shore, connected to the mainland only by a thin land-bridge that disappears at high-tide. The party stopped off here to leave Gerrth, an unfortunate werewolf-turned-human, hoping the Mages of the Circle could restore him to his proper form. It is a heavily-guarded sanctuary for Marinese mages. Many the party saw were locked in their rooms, manacled and escorted everywhere by guards and mercenaries from across Mondial, including Cloudstone Deep Miners and Au'vanwa raiders.
