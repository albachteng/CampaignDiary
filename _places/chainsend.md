The capitol city of the Kingdom of Marina, Chain's End sits over the mouth of the River *Llewellyn's Chain* ("The Chain"). It is the seat of nobility and the largest city in Mondial. <br><br> *Chain's End* is constructed over the mouth of the river in the shape of an enormous bridge. Water-powered elevators and ship locks allow cargo to move up the structure to Castle Marina at its peak. Reflecting the conlficted nature of Marina itself, the city is crowded with both noble soldiers and cutthroat pirates.
