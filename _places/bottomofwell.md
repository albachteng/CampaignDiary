North of Redwater, an old, dried-up well at the edge of the forest turned out to be the peak of a buried tower to an old sunken church. Here the adventurers had their first encounter with the drow, dark-robed humanoids. The drow they fought were infected with a frenzied madness that transformed them into hideous beasts. Ultimately, more - uninfected - drow joined the fray and killed their frenzied brethren before snapping a *staff of power* to cause the cathedral to collapse.
