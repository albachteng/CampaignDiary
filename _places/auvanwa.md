The name for both the people and their home-in-exile. The Au'vanwa consider themselves not to be natives of Mondial, despite having lived here for generations. They are a group of elves, minotaurs and dragonborn, collectively "Lost and Away." Au'vanwa is hidden away in the desert near the Great Rift, far to the north-east. Their people shun the forests for fear of The Voice Within the Trees that calls them back to The Weald, where they believe the Raven King would seek to control them once more.
