The Knights are a clandestine group, often disguised as beggars or servants, more assassins and spies than proper Knights. In times past, the Knights supplemented their skill at arms with magic, but those arts are lost to the modern Knight. Their weapons and attire are designed to hide their status and equipment rather than display it.<br><br>When the players met Ada, she was serving Duke Geoffrey undercover as a "tutor" to the Lady Dauphine, his daughter. She is regularly charged with equipping and debriefing the adventurers in their contract work with Marina.

It appears her name was once Abigail, however, since the Knight Simon, stationed in Lundis, asked the party to deliver to "Abigail" a locket bearing her image. She accepted the item without a word from Lem.
