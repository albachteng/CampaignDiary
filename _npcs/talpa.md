The generous leader of a caravan of Au'vanwa, and the first living soul our party encountered in Mondial. The caravan he leads was seeking work as mercenaries in Chain's End, but were turned away due to an unknown plague. The nomadic elf shared his fire, his wine, as well as his knowledge of the Artifacts and The War of the Lights.

Talpa's name was found etched into a bookcase in the towers of the Circle of Illusion. But the Au'vanwa are said to shun the Great Forest. His current whereabouts are unknown.
