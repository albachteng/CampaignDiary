name: Tzitzik, "Hanford Paddle"
place: Marina
---
The chief engineer of *The Gin Mule*, a pirate ship conscripted into service for Marina. He was caught scratching strange signs into the side of the ship and was apprehended by the party. When confronted on his scheming, the goblin gave up little, except to say that he had "saved everyone" and that "Lucius awakens." Lem spent a great deal of time trying to understand the Water Elemental-powered engine that he created for the ship, indicating that Tzitzik was an artificer of no small skill. He died during the party's search of the abandoned ship, *The Last Word*.
