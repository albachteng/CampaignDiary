Long a tormentor to Hubert as he came up in his training as a Church Assassin, Narissa was promoted in his absence to Inquisitor, and was even rumored to be the heir apparent to newly appointed High Inquisitor Noska. Narissa was a cold, calculating and viciously cruel person, and she reserved her worst for Hubert. She openly questioned Hubert's right to be a member of the Church hierarchy, wealdscum that he is, and promised to eradicate the non-human elements from the Church when she inevitably ascended to Noska's position.

The adventurers killed Narissa during their escape from the Catacombs and the fall of White Tower.
