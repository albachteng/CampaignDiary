The jovial and rotund Duke of Redwater, although he spends more time in Chain's End dealing with the King and parliament. Still, the people of Redwater love him and call him "The Good Duke Geoffrey, Blessing of the Four Winds upon him!" Shortly after meeting the party Geoffrey was the target of an assassination attempt by unknown forces. Subsequently, he revealed to his adventurous saviors that he was once a member of the Knights of Marina, a clandestine group of warriors in service of the King.

He has since hired the adventurers several times and has become their primary benefactor. There is a sadness to him for all the laughter and friendliness - for his daughter, the Lady Dauphine, is desperately ill and he cannot save her.
