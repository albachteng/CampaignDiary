name: Duke Geoffrey
place: Marina

The jovial and rotund Duke of Redwater, although he spends more time in Chain's End dealing with the King and parliament. Still, the people of Redwater love him and call him "The Good Duke Geoffrey, Blessing of the Four Winds upon him!" Shortly after meeting the party (and imprisoning them on the word of his Steward, Anders) Geoffrey was the target of an assassination attempt by unknown forces. Subsequently, he revealed to his adventurous saviors that he was once a member of the Knights of Marina, a clandestine group of warriors in service of the King. Now he has another job for the adventurers: find out who tried to have him killed, and why. And so the party sets off for Lundis and the Great Forest.

Geoffrey himself was a Knight once as well - which explains why the party found his armor still in the attic.
