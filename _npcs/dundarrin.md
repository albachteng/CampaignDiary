A dwarf of Cloudstone, one of the few the party has ever encountered. He was a member of the Deep Miner's Guild, a band of mercenaries worth their weight in gold. 

At first, he was an ally to the party, aiding in the assault on White Tower. When the battle was won, he turned on the party, helping Makar to assassinate the Queen of Lundis and welcoming the approaching Disparian army - and their dragons. All part of the plan, according to him. 

His fate is unknown.
