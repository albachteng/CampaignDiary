This mysterious and unkempt dwarf has popped up along the party's path through Mondial too many times for it to be a coincidence. He seems to be much more powerful than he lets on, exhibiting control over stone, earth and lightning. He speaks in riddles, contradicts himself, and has even unceremoniously pushed Lem into a fiery pit. He has warned the party that he is "a bad friend, and a very good enemy."
