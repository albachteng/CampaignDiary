Captain of *The Gin Mule*, a former pirate conscripted into service for the king. An older man, Davenport often tells tales of his time living through the events of The War of Bays, in which Disparia invaded what was once Marinese lands near The Rifts. Despite his age, he managed to survive being thrown overboard during an attack by the kraken - in no small part due to the party's quick thinking and persistence.
