A mysteroius figure, long believed to have been killed in a cataclysmic event known as "The Tragedy of Einan" in songs. He was a prince of Disparia who established the greatest school of magic of his time: The Circle of Evocation. 

Whatever it was he was studying, it resulted in a conflagration that burn the circle and its towers to ash. It was because of this act that magic was nearly outlawed in the human kingdoms. 

Lem freed him from his Mirror to help them kill a trio of adult dragons that Disparia had unleashed on White Tower. His current whereabouts are unknown.
