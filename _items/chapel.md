<br><br>Trick: Bonus action transforms this saber into a bladed whip, gaining the long-reach property (a 15ft range). 
<br><br>It gains the Arcane property when transformed, allowing you to add your intelligence modifier to attack and damage rolls. 
<br><br>In the transformed state, you cannot attack enemies within 5ft of you, including attacks of opportunity. You can, however, make attacks of opportunity against opponents who exit your 15ft range.
