name: Crystal Oil
type: consummable
---
Coating a non-magical weapon in this oil (which requires one action) adds 1d8 force, cold or psychic damage (your choice) to the weapon's attacks for 3 rounds. The weapon gains the Arcane property for the duration, allowing you to add your Intelligence modifier to the damage and attack roll. 

You cannot use this consummable on a weapon that already has a bonus to attack or damage.
