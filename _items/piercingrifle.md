2d6 piercing damage, range (300/600ft), ammunition, reload (2), piercing. <br><br>The piercing property is new. When you shoot a creature, you can also hit additional creatures in a line behind the creature you were aiming for. You must make a new attack roll, and the damage die decreases by one for each additional creature beyond the first shot in this manner. <br><br>This property allows you to hit a creature behind the one you were aiming for, even if you missed that attack. In other words, you continue rolling attack rolls on enemies in a straight line until the damage die have been reduced to 0 or you have run out of targets. <br><br>The reload property means you can fire (in this case) twice before you must reload. If you are proficient, you can reload with a bonus action (which requires one free hand). If you are not proficient, you must use your action. This property can be improved.
