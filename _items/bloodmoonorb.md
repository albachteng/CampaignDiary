Requires attunement. When held in one hand, the orb can be activated with an action. This pale crystal orb floats in the air above you and showers a rain of blood in a 60ft radius. Any creature caught in the mist must make a DC15 DEX save (including yourself). On a fail, all magical effects on that creature are dispelled and all magical items cease to function as anything other than mundane objects for ten minutes. In addition, creatures that fail their saving throw cannot be healed by any means for the duration, and all temporary HP is immediately eliminated. All creatures affected, including you, must roll a D20. Add the result, without modifiers, to your frenzy level.
