Beldryn changed his last name to Bronzeheart after joining the Bronze Bank of Filia to hide his shame: he was ousted from the Iron Halls for a foolhardy ploy in the War of the Golden Mountains. Seeking to force a quick end to the war, he gambled with the lives of an entire battalion under his command throwing them in full force against the advancing enemy, but was outsmarted by the Goblins of the nearby Iron Hills. Almost none survived the battle, although the dwarves did eventually win the war. His true name is Beldryn Runeguard, making him the heir to a long line of decorated Kingsguard.<br><br>Beldryn died defending *The Last Word* and its crew, wielding the *Moonlight Greatsword* against a mighty kraken with a woman's face.
