The party knew little of his kind before arriving in Mondial, but Ulrach of the Au'vanwa quickly demonstrated that his kind are trustworthy, serious and capable warriors. His tribe instilled in him a powerful distrust of arcane artifacts and The Art, but with Chain's End closed and his tribe desperate for resources, he agrees to join the adventurers to investigate the practices of Lundis and The Circle of Illusion within the forests he was taught to avoid for the good of his tribe.
