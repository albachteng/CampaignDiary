                        <p>Beldryn changed his last name to Bronzeheart after joining the Bronze Bank 
                            of Filia to hide his shame: he was ousted from the Iron Halls for a foolhardy 
                            ploy in the War of the Golden Mountains. Seeking to force a quick end to the war, 
                            he gambled with the lives of an entire battalion under his command throwing them 
                            in full force against the advancing enemy, but was outsmarted by the Goblins of 
                            the nearby Iron Hills. Almost none survived the battle, although the dwarves did 
                            eventually win the war. His true name is Beldryn Runeguard, making him the heir 
                            to a long line of decorated Kingsguard.  </p>

                        <p>The generous and kindhearted leader of a caravan of Au'vanwa, and the
                            first living soul our party encountered in Mondial. The caravan he leads
                            was seeking work as mercenaries in Chain's End, but were turned away due 
                            to an unknown plague. The nomadic elf shared his fire, his wine, as well 
                            as his knowledge of the Artifacts and The War of the Lights.

                    <h4>Anders</h4>
                    <p>The cold and calculating Steward of Redwater. He serves at the pleasure of
                        the Good Duke Geoffrey, brother to the King. Anders hired the party to find
                        and eliminate those responsible for attacks on trade caravans along the East
                        Road towards Balnying. Upon their return, he insists that the mercenaries lie
                        about the cause of the attacks, blaming everything on Disparia.

                    <h4>Ora</h4>
                    <p>Ora was a mage of The Circle of Illusion, but she ran away for unknown reasons. 
                        She describes life in The Circles as dangerous and oppressive, and she has deep
                        scars to prove it. She aided the party in their search for the creatures attacking
                        Redwater's caravans before vanishing from her home.

                    <h2>Locations</h2>
                    <h3>Kingdoms and Cities</h3>
                    <h4>Marina</h4>
                        <p>Canonically founded by the Goddess of Storm and Sea Marinal, 
                            the people of Marina are a sea-faring sort, although they readily
                            admit that they do not venture far from the sight of shore - those who
                            do are rarely seen again. Marina's dominance of the waters has led to 
                            conflict with Disparia in the past. Regardless, they are an overwhelmingly
                            pastoral land, with broad swathes of land dedicated to agriculture. Marina
                            was the first and currently only kingdom to make trade with the Goblins for
                            their smokepowder weapons.
                        </p>
                    <h5>Chain's End</h5>
                        <p>The capitol city of the Kingdom of Marina, Chain's End sits at the 
                            mouth of the River Llewellyn's Chain ("The Chain"). It is the seat of
                            nobility and the largest city in Mondial. Talpa Adamina informs the party
                            that it is currently in lock-down due to an unknown plague. 
                        </p>
                    <h5>Redwater</h5>
                        <p>Sitting at the top of the peninsula known as Marinal's Call, Redwater is ideally situated to observe
                            any potential invasions by sea. Even enemy ships seeking to surprise Marina
                            from Disparia would have to stick close to shore and would therefore need to
                            take a long route around the Call. It is a well-fortified town of modest size. 
                            It takes its name from the last war with Disparia, where its walls marked the high-water 
                            mark of the Disparian advance. 
                        </p>
                    <image src="resources/images/Redwater.png"></image>
                    <h5>Balnying</h5>
                        <p>"Goblin Town" to those who can't bother to pronounce it. Its name means "Gift of Fire" 
                            and it is known as the largest settlement of the otherwise underground-dwelling people 
                            called Goblins. It is most-well known for being regularly burnt to the groun by the
                            eccentric experiments of its populace, who are devout tinkers. Redwater residents tell
                            the party that Knights have been dispatched from Chain's End to keep an eye on the continued
                            development of dangerous weaponry. 
                        </p>
                    <h4>Disparia</h4>
                        <p>Friends to none, the Disparians are known to be militant and fiercely protective. Their
                            proximity to the desert leads to regular conflict with the Au'vanwa nomads that dwell there. 
                            Disparia invaded Marina in generations past, but Marina held the line, ultimately ceding 
                            the Bay of Fire to the Disparian King. 
                        </p>
                    <h5>Malachi's Watch</h5>
                        <p>The Capitol of Disparia, known as The City of Locked Doors. Its residents are 
                            staunchly opposed to allowing outsiders within its walls, and fiercely anti-magic.
                        </p>
                    <h4>Lundis</h4>
                        <p>Smallest of the human Kingdoms, the city is protected primarily by its location: deep 
                            in the enchanted and beast-filled forests at the center of Mondial, where few dare to 
                            travel. Its proximity to The Circle of Illusion has led to the general belief that they 
                            are the most sympathetic to the practice of magic. Their major export is a variety of 
                            healing potion with a bioluminescent glow. The party learns from Talpa that their Church
                            claims to have developed a means of preventing the frenzy that comes with the use of Artifacts.
                        </p>
                    <h5>White Tower</h5>
                        <p>The mysterious Capitol of Lundis, deep in the illusory forest at the center of Mondial. 
                            Seat of the Church of Lundis, at the head of which sits their King. 
                        </p>
                    <h3>Other Locations</h3>
                    <h4>Au'vanwa</h4>
                        <p>The name for both the people and their home-in-exile. The Au'vanwa consider themselves
                            not to be natives of Mondial. They are a group of elves, minotaurs and dragonborn, collectively 
                            "Lost and Away." Au'vanwa is hidden away in the desert near the Great Rift, far to the north-east. Their
                            people shun the forests for fear of The Voice Within the Trees that calls them back to The Weald, where they believe 
                            the Raven King would seek to control them once more. </p>
                    <h4>The Circle of Illusion</h4>
                            <p>Across the River Llewellyn's Chain, in the great forests at Mondial's center, is a loose 
                                confederacy of Mages. Spurned from the human kingdoms for their magical talents, the mages ban together
                                for safety. Ora tells the party that it is a terrible place that brought more questions than answers. 
                                Of course, nothing in the Circle of Illusion is what it seems. Who knows to what ends they practice their charms?
                            </p>
                    <h4>The School of Talen</h4>
                            <p>Known only to the Outlanders as a place of study, it is a Lundisian operation by the sea far to the west. 
                                The Scholars seek to uncover the truth about the Artifacts - and their use.

                            Her child is identified only as "The Moon". Her worshp also seems to be related to the four winds:

                        <h3>The Last Word</h3>
                        <image src="resources/images/kraken.jpg"></image>
                        <aside>The heat of the sun, coupled with the 
                        stillness of the air, weighs on you 
                        oppressively. The sparse cries of seagulls 
                        punctuate the steady, lazy lapping of waves 
                        against the ship on which you are passengers. 
                        The salt air mingles with the sweat of sailors. 
                        You were hired to protect The Last Word and its 
                        cargo by a group of Filian Wizards. It is day ten.
                        </aside>
                        <p>Our party of adventurous mercenaries notice strange
                        behavior from water elementals, as well as an unusual
                        bioluminescent algae bloom in the waters as night approaches.
                        The Wizard Oneth of Filia, revealed some of the precious cargo
                        <em>The Last Word</em> carries, which includes several "Candidates"
                        - rare magical Artifacts - a silvery greatsword, a pair of daggers
                        given the name <em>The Wren and the Nightingale</em> and a mace 
                        with a bell-shaped head.
                        </p>
                        <p><em>The Last Word</em> meets its apparent end shortly thereafter. 
                        The ship is attacked by monstrous crabs with hooded human torsos. A kraken emerges from the depths. Behind its beak, Isho witnesses a serenly smiling face. Beldryn dies fighting the monstrosity with <em>The Moonlight Greatsword</em>. The rest of the party is plunged into black waters, and silence.</p>

                        <h3>The Lighthouse</h3>
                        <image src="resources/images/Lighthouse.jpg"></image>
                        <aside>You wake up to the sound of waves. A single seagull crying overhead - followed by the call of a raven. The taste of salt, the scent of the ocean. Every part of you hurts, you are sore as if beaten. Your clothes and belongings are damp and filled with sand. You were chewed up and spit out by the Ocean herself. Every breath you take is a miracle. Distant memories of the voyage return to you, as if from another life. You can still hear an echo of the voices of sailors, shouting orders, fearfully.</aside>
                        <p>The party awakes on mysterious shores and travels to a nearby Lighthouse. As they approach, the sound of bullets ricocheting off the ground signals to them that they are not alone. Lem climbs the tower, invisible, while Rawson and Isho storm the building from the front. Inside, they are faced with a strange blue-hooded knight, quietly singing to itself and bearing smokepowder weapons unknown to them. The knight has bright orange glowing eyes and is accompanied by a handful of rabbid dogs.</p>
                        <p>Thanks in no small part to the arrival of backup in the form of Ulrach, the Au'vanwa minotaur, the party is able to defeat the mysterious knight. Together, the now reinforced party makes its way to Ulrach's tribal caravan, where Talpa Adamina, their leader, welcomes the strangers to the land of Mondial, and the Kingdom of Marina.</p>

                        <h3>Redwater</h3>
                        <image src="resources/images/Harbor.jpg"></image>
                        <aside>The town is abuzz with activity. It sits on the water, wrapping its walls close to the shoreline to surround a modest harbor. Smaller sailing ships lazily drift in and out. A guard tower rises from the water at the end of a stone jetty. In the center of town, an open square appears crowded around a large tavern, smoke pouring from its many high chimneys. The smell of smoked meats and fish fill the air. Closer to the city gate, you can hear the cries of men at work on the walls, and at the forges. 
                        </aside>
                        <p>In Redwater, the party splits to seek out supplies and work. With most of their belongings lost in the shipwreck, and with the town overrun by refugees from the nearby farms, finding affordable goods and paying work proves difficult.</p>
                        <p>Ulrach and Lemullius discover the strange minority race of Pygmies, neither a halfling nor a gnome, but a dark-skinned humanoid of small stature. Lem receives help in the form of equipment in exchange for information about recent prisoner transfers from Redwater to the Marinese capitol of Chain's End. He learns that all the recent transfers were Pygmies.</p>
                        <p>After a vision, Isho explores the open-air Cathedral to the Four Winds, where he witnesses the Marinese worship of "Marina - Our Lady of Storm and Sea - and her child, The Moon." Although he discovers little else about their religion, it occurs to him that he has seen this face before.</p>
                        <p>Rawson chats up the locals and is directed to a Tavern - <em>The Tangled Net</em>, where he reunites with the party in time for a brawl, and learns that the people of Redwater are not universally friendly to Outlanders, Mages and the Au'vanwa.</p>
                        <p>The brawl brings them the attention of Anders Willifort, the Steward of Redwater in the absence of "The Good Duke" Geoffrey. Shipments to and from the nearby Goblin settlement of Balnying have been attacked on the road. Anders suspects locals or Disparians and hires the party to put an end to the attacks. And so the investigation begins.</p>

                        <h3>Bottom of the Well</h3>
                        <image src="resources/images/Cathedral Ceiling.png"></image>
                        <aside>You descend forty feet down the old well, noting the intricate carvings along its edges, matching them to the Lighthouse at the tip of the peninsula Marinal's Call. At its base is a staircase spiraling even further into the depths. The hall to the south is caved in, but to the north you are met with high, stained-glass windows. As you continue your exploration, the ceiling opens up into a high dome. Reflected in the glass, in frescoes, in statues carved into columns, the cathedral's repeating motifs is that of a serenely smiling sun and feathered wings.</aside>
                        <p>The party's investigations topside lead them to Ora, a witch at the edge of the woods a day's journey due north of Redwater. She reveals to the party that she has been hiding from both the Marinese authorities - whose anti-magic sensibilities were on full display in Redwater - as well as the Circle of Illusion, a coalition of mages deep in the forests to the north, past the river <em>Llewellyn's Chain</em>. Her practices have aided the locals to some degree, so they keep her presence a secret.</p>
                        <aside>"For ten years, I have lived here at the edge of the forest. And every night, for ten years, I cast the same spell: I send my awareness out into the nearby forest and detect the other minds as they come and go from my home. For ten years, I have lived in fear that I would detect the Mages of the Circle coming from the North. Ten days ago, I detected something else: empty minds, emerging from deep within the earth."</aside>
                        <p>At the bottom of the old well, the party discovers a sunken cathedral just below the surface of the earth. Its high stained-glass windows face only earth and darkness now. At the east end of the grand hall, the party fights a trio of ghouls and discovers the catacombs of a once-powerful elvish race. To the west, the party finds three statues and a glowing orange lichen. The statues depict a bent humanoid wearing a cracked laughing mask, a chained giant holding a hammer and chisel, and a tall man with a serenly smiling sun for a face.</p>
                        <p>Their investigations are interrupted by the attack of shrouded humanoid figures, firing volleys from darkness, both mundane and magical. Their leader wields a longsword that expands into a bladed whip. Nearing the end of his powers, his flesh erupts in a shower of blood and he transforms into a monstrous, orange-eyed lycanthrope. Although there are some close calls, the party is victorious.</p>
                        <p>At the end of the assault, the party is surprised to discover a pair of allies among the dark figures. Two of the unknown race emerge from the tunnels at the end of the cathedral to kill off their brethren. One tosses a necklace with a moon-shaped pendant to the party and then snaps a staff of power across its knee, giving one longing look past the party to the faint light of the sun gently falling down the well as the sun rises. The broken staff erupts with the power to shatter several of the support columns, and the party flees the collapsing cathedral.</p>
