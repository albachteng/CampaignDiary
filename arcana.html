        "This kingdom is called Marina, one of four on the continent the humans call Mondial. Your kind, the Goblins, call it Uca, which means High, but we can say little more of them. We are not from Marina, we of the Auâ€™vanwa are a desert-dwelling people, but we are not from Mondial either. We call this place the Mundane Lands."

    <h1>Religion</h1>
    <p>The human kingdoms have a shared patheon, but disagree on who sits at its peak. There are also deviations in their mythologies. Some of these disagreements are detailed below. Other races have gods and pantheons of their own, and most religions tell stories of the wars between the gods, which continue today.</p>
