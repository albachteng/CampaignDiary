I"è<p>Requires attunement. This twinsword has +2 to attack and damage rolls.</p>

<p>Trick: As a bonus action, you can separate it into a rapier and dagger, which also are +2 weapons that deal 1d6 each but are otherwise identical to a rapier and dagger (finesse, light, thrown, etc). Attacks are considered magical. It has the following additional properties.</p>

<p>First Blood: Only after you have lost 50% of your total HP, as an action, you can expend 2 hit die and cut yourself to impale the weapons with your own blood (this deals no damage to you, and the wounds you create in this manner heal instantaneously). Your attacks gain the reach property (+5 feet) and deal an additional 1d10 necrotic damage. When you take this action, you must roll 1d4 and add the number to your frenzy. 
Exsanguinate: After having taken the First Blood action, you may take an action to expunge the blood from the blades, losing the effects of first blood. Doing so creates a 20ft explosion of fire centered on yourself. This has the effect of casting fireball centered on yourself. The DC for the dexterity save is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your charisma modifier. All creatures that fail the save take 8d6 fire damage and half as much on a successful save. You have advantage on the saving throw and instead take no damage on a save and half damage on a failure. Regardless, you must roll 1d4 and add the number to your frenzy.</p>
