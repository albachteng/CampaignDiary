I"Ê<p>Isho hails from the sands beyond the Golden Hills, making him a foreigner among foreigners in the party. A member of a nomadic tribe, he was raised as a Sun Warrior, like his father before him and his grandmother before that. He carries with him a small amount of desert sands, which serves as an oracle for ritual divination, and wields the distinctive yari swordspear of his people. Isho is a stalwart warrior, often rushing to the front of the group to serve as the partyâ€™s bulwark. He speaks Common slowly and carefully, unfamiliar as he is with the language, and he often finds the lifestyle of city dwellers confusing, but his strong moral character makes him the heart and conscience of the party.</p>
