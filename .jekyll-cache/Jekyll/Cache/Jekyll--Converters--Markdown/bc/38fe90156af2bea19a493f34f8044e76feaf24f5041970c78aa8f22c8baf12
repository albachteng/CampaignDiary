  <p>From the Trades you are led through the Palisades, past the burnt body of a mage, now frozen solid in place. You are accompanied by first ten and eventually twenty royal guard, all of their faces covered by impassive silver masks. Their leather armor is clean and tightly-fitted. Some of them shake - whether from the cold or from fear of the large bovine monstrosity they have captured is unclear. <br /><br />They move quickly and silently through the streets up to the Eastern Barricade. No one seems to recognize Hubert, or perhaps you manage to blend in with the group. The entire setting is quickly given a once-over by the guards for magical items, and then you are given entry to The Upper Cathedral Ward. A long bridge connects the dark facade of the Cathedral to the central White Tower from which the city gets its name. <br /><br />You are led across well-maintained quadrangles and parks, passing snow-covered gothic buildings of stone. You are led through the upper levels and balconies of the Grand Cathedral itself - high walls, crystal lamps and towering stained glass, catching a brief glimpse of a man on a pedestal in the midst of his daily sermon, inviting the congregation to partake of Communion passed around in great silver bowls - before finally being led down into the dark depths of the Catacombs.</p>

<p>Ulrach is led beyond an iron portcullis and into an open domed space, a medical theatre. Behind rows of raised seating is a small jail. Ulrach takes the fourth cell, behind a steadily chanting madman, the desperately screaming former owner of <em>The Autumn Leaf</em> and a sleeping pygmy. Here he is tortured and healed repeatedly by a set of royal guards, while a Scholar with a telescopic monocle enters with vials and syringes to prep the minotaur for “surgery.” Ulrach answers none of their questions.</p>

<p>Hubert’s con seems to have worked, and he is invited to rest in the barracks deeper within the Catacombs, further down than he has ever been allowed before. Wandering, he finds resting Royal Guards, letting their masks down and discussing someone named “Nathaniel”. They talk of him ironically, as if he were a pet in need of care. Hubert discovers large supplies of <em>Communion</em> and healing potions, as well as equipment for excavation before running into a long-time tormentor: Inquisitor Narissa. She berates Hubert and repeats her promise to expunge all wealdscum from the Church when she is made High Inquisitor.</p>

<p>After some verbal sparring, Hubert explores the Catacombs further, discovering an ornate throne room filled with black marble and gold, walls adorned with mosaics of suns, moons and trees and surrounded by statues of deceased royalty of the house Rutvyen.</p>

<p>He finds a guarded dwarf, whose legs have been brutally crushed, pulling himself across the floor on a wheeled wooden board and building</p>
