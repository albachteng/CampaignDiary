I"ý<p>Deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage and is otherwise functionally a regular mace, except where noted below.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Trick: The mace head is a tarnished bronze cup. Use an action to transform, which reveals it to be a bell. It gains the long-reach property (15ft melee range) and its damage becomes psychic and can be applied to all enemies in range (in other words, 15 ft circle around you). Gains the Arcane property, allowing you to add your Intelligence Modifier to damage and attack rolls.</li>
