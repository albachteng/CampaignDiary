        The heat of the sun, coupled with the 
        stillness of the air, weighs on you 
        oppressively. The sparse cries of seagulls 
        punctuate the steady, lazy lapping of waves 
        against the ship on which you are passengers. 
        The salt air mingles with the sweat of sailors. 
        You were hired to protect The Last Word and its 
        cargo by a group of Filian Wizards. It is day ten.

    The Wizard Oneth of Filia, revealed some of the precious cargo
    &lt;em&gt;The Last Word&lt;/em&gt; carries, which includes several "Candidates"
    - rare magical Artifacts - a silvery greatsword, a pair of daggers
    given the name &lt;em&gt;The Wren and the Nightingale&lt;/em&gt; and a mace 
    with a bell-shaped head.



    &lt;em&gt;The Last Word&lt;/em&gt; meets its apparent end shortly thereafter. 
    The ship is attacked by monstrous crabs with hooded human torsos. A kraken emerges from the depths. Behind its beak, Isho witnesses a serenly smiling face. Beldryn dies fighting the monstrosity with &lt;em&gt;The Moonlight Greatsword&lt;/em&gt;. The rest of the party is plunged into black waters, and silence.
