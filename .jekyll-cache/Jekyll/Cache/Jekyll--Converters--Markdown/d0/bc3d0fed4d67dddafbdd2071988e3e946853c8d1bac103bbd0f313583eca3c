  <p>Seawatch from a distance resembles a tall, smooth shield facing the sea. The town of Oarâ€™s Rest lies in its shadow at dusk, but at dawn the light shines on the cliff face. Far above, you can hear the occasional distant sounds of rumbling and hammering, and see smoke and steam rising from the summit. Lemâ€™s instructions from the Goblins on The Pebble at Chainâ€™s End tell him to look at the base of the mountain for an entrance to the Underdark left hidden and sealed by the Goblins. The under-mountain is filled with dangers and the abandoned mechanisms of the Goblin confederates. According to them, only a Goblin can open the door now.</p>

  <p>The door is cut into the rock face so precisely that if you werenâ€™t looking for it, you might never find it.

<p>Seawatch is a dormant volcano - abundantly and immediately apparent to the party after wandering through sweltering crevices and the red-orange glow of lava flows. The party faces heavily-armed knights, their weapons and armor singed black with soot, that attack over a narrow bridge suspended above the hot chasm above the caldera.</p>

And here they find Rogga, singing to himself happily, â€œBrother Mountainâ€¦ something is calling to meâ€¦â€</p>

<p>Rogga says Hubert â€œdoes not know his own faceâ€ which seems to please Hubert, who asks him about Einan. â€œLittle Einan, he knows his own face. He wants to see it again,â€ says Rogga. Rogga declares himself to be a â€œbad friend, and a good enemyâ€ before kicking Lem off the ledge and into the pit of lava below. Halfway down, Lemâ€™s descent slows and he manages to land gently on one of the crumbling structures.</p>

<p>While the party members hesitate, unsure how to react to Roggaâ€™s antics, Rogga whispers: â€œsomething is comingâ€¦ calling to meâ€¦â€ and then - his eyes burn white-hot, electric currents crackle around his form, he crouches back and rockets towards Ulrach with a speed like lightning. At the last minute, Rogga veers off of Ulrachâ€™s shoulder and pins The Gentleman against the wall - a fey creature that, moments ago, none of the party could apparently see. Rogga wrestles the</p>
