  <p>The drow approach the Cathedral and form a ring around it, several hundred yards back. There are dozens and dozens of them, eyes glowing with an intense orange light. They stand stiffly, gazing ahead without understanding or feeling. After a time, the infected drow begin rhythmically pounding their staves, axes and swords against the ground, the sound swelling into a steady beat that echoes off the cavern walls. Out of the darkness beyond steps another blue, tentacled alien creature, dragging behind it the charred corpse of a dwarf - the one left behind. The drow make room for the monstrosity, who steps a few feet forward and, with its bare hands, rips open a hole in the back of the dwarf‚Äôs skull and slides something alive and kicking into the cavity of his head. The dwarf stands, eyes glowing bright.</p>

<p>Taking refuge in the cathedral, the party plans its next move and explores their surroundings. Everything about this cathedral reminds them of the bottom of the old well outside Redwater. There are stained glass windows depicted old gods: the serenly smiling sun, a chained giant, a laughing imp. There are also depictions of the gods of Mondial‚Äôs surface: the skeletal Malorn, the dancer Marinal and the chessmaster Malachi. But most disturbing are the stained glass surrounding the central altar, depicting a greatsword wielding dwarf, a dual-wielding half-elf, a humanoid with a spear and shield, a human with a rifle and longbow, a goblin with a bayoneted gun and a minotaur carrying a flaming hammer. One window is shattered. The images are a perfect match to our heroes.</p>

<p>Summoning their strength, the party rallies and scales the cathedral spires to reach the cave ceiling, where another door has been crudely cut into a stalagmite. They escape the drow here and barricade the door behind them.</p>

<p>The party slips through narrow crevices until they find the Deep Roads again. Rogga meets them here and ominously warns them of ‚Äúegress‚Äù ahead. A slight earthquake shakes the ground and Rogga speaks again of ‚ÄúBrother Mountain‚Äù, as if he were talking of a friend. He asks: ‚ÄúWhen forest on fire, you m ust put out. How?</p>
