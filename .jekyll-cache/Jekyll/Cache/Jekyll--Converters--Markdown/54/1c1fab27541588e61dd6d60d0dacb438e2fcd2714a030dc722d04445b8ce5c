  <p>You see the lock hours before you reach it. The river cuts into what appears to be a mountain, beyond which shimmers the restless sea. The sun blinds you at first, but the closer you get, the clearer it becomes that the mountain is a city, built in layers around and over the river like a great bridge. A sort of dam has been built into the cityâ€™s sheer face.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Enormous gates seal off the river at all sides near the wall. As your ship approaches, those gates slide up and out as waves of water empty into the dam from the shaft. Briefly, your boat is pushed back by the force of water emptying out of the lock. The boat spins in place, the riverâ€™s mighty current slowed for a time. Finally, when the elevator is empty, the captain directs the boat through this narrow passage into the shaft.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can hear and feel the turning of enormous gears, the flow and drip of water being pumped into the chamber as the door is sealed behind you. The water rises, imperceptibly slow at first, and then in a great burst of engineering might, you are lifting, up, up, up, hundreds of feet into the air above the city walls, above the clustered homes and towers at its base, above the spires of its churches. At the top of the lock, your boat peeks over the high walls of the elevator and you can see blue sky all around you, blue water far below, and the gates swing open to empty your ship into a narrow channel that makes up the roadways of the highest level of the Castle at Chainâ€™s End.</p>

<p>The party is greeted by Duke Geoffrey, Captain Heywood Loom and Knight Ada Dalton. They are also surprised to see Hans, a cauliflower-eared ruffian who fought Ulrach in a bar in Redwater, way back when. Hubert is separated from the rest of the group and placed under house arrest - over the partyâ€™s vigorous protest. As a self-professed Assassin of the Church, he is considered a security threat, even without the ability to walk.</p>

<p>Each member of the party is individually debriefed. The party chooses not to tell Chainâ€™s End about Hubertâ€™s assassination of Magnus, nor about Rogga, nor of the Mirror. They pass their checks, are paid handsomely, and invited to meet with the King himself.</p>

<p>King Balin is, unfortunately, a mess of a man. When he arrives he is deep into a bottle of something strong, smoking heavily and absolutely reeking. He is a bear of a man,</p>
