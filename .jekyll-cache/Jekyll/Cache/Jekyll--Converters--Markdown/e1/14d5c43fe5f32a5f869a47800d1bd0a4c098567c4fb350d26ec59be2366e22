I"4<p>“Goblin Town” to those who can’t bother to pronounce it. 
        Its name means “Gift of Fire” and it is known as the largest 
        settlement of the otherwise underground-dwelling people 
        called Goblins. It is most-well known for being regularly 
        burnt to the groun by the eccentric experiments of its 
        populace, who are devout tinkers. Redwater residents tell 
        the party that Knights have been dispatched from Chain’s 
        End to keep an eye on the continued development of dangerous 
        weaponry.</p>
