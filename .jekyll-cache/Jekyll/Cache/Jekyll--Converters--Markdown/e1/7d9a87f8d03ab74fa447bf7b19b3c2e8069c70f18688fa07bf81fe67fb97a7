  <p>Seawatch from a distance resembles a tall, smooth shield facing the sea. The town of Oar’s Rest lies in its shadow at dusk, but at dawn the light shines on the cliff face. Far above, you can hear the occasional distant sounds of rumbling and hammering, and see smoke and steam rising from the summit. Lem’s instructions from the Goblins on The Pebble at Chain’s End tell him to look at the base of the mountain for an entrance to the Underdark left hidden and sealed by the Goblins. The under-mountain is filled with dangers and the abandoned mechanisms of the Goblin confederates. According to them, only a Goblin can open the door now.</p>

  <p>The door is cut into the rock face so precisely that if you weren’t looking for it, you might never find it. It is a crude door, but as Lem approaches, he can see a rough message etched into the stone - a mixture of Goblin code, undercommon and transcribed thieves’ cant. Lucky for the party, Lem is perfectly positioned to make sense of it.</p>

<p>Seawatch is a dormant volcano - abundantly and immediately apparent to the party after wandering through sweltering crevices and the red-orange glow of lava flows. The party faces heavily-armed knights, their weapons and armor singed black with soot, that attack over a narrow bridge suspended above the hot chasm above the caldera.</p>

<p>Lem leads the party into a wide open space filled with crumbling structures half-sunk in lava. The room also features hanging walkways and some sort of chain-and-pully system on a conveyor belt above their heads. Some of the platforms have levers and dials on them. And here they find Rogga, singing to himself happily, “Brother Mountain… something is calling to me…”</p>

<p>Rogga says Hubert “does not know his own face” which seems to please Hubert, who asks him about Einan. “Little Einan, he knows his own face. He wants to see it again,” says Rogga. Rogga declares himself to be a “bad friend, and a good enemy” before kicking Lem off the ledge and into the pit of lava below. Halfway down, Lem’s descent slows and he manages to land gently on one of the crumbling structures.</p>

<p>While the party members hesitate, unsure how to react to Rogga’s antics, Rogga whispers: “something is coming… calling to me…” and then - his eyes burn white-hot, electric currents crackle around his form, he crouches back and rockets towards Ulrach with a speed like lightning. At the last minute, Rogga veers off of Ulrach’s shoulder and pins The Gentleman against the wall - a fey creature that, moments ago, none of the party could apparently see. Rogga wrestles The Gentleman to the ground, who attempts to transform into the black-feathered dragon again, but the two wink out of vision and are seen no more.</p>
