I"g<p>Across the river <em>Llewellyn’s Chain</em>, in the great forests at Mondial’s center, is a loose confederacy of Mages. Spurned from the human kingdoms for their magical talents, the mages ban together for safety. Ora tells the party that it is a terrible place that brought more questions than answers. Of course, nothing in the Circle of Illusion is what it seems. Who knows to what ends they practice their charms? <br /><br />The Circle of Illusion was abandoned when the heroes arrived - by all save Kolat, who was barely sane. He was attempting to force the Mirror which contained Einan to reveal its secrets to him. By killing Kolat, the party killed the last remaining mage of the Circle of Illusion. It is now an abandoned village in the middle of the Great Forest, where masterless golems roam aimlessly, protecting an enclave that no longer exists.</p>
