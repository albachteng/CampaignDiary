  <p>His Eye is Watching.</p>

<p>The leadership of <em>His Eye</em>, the revolutionaries plotting to overthrow the Pontiff Sulyvahn and his tyranical Church, are made up of the dwarf Dundarrin of the Cloudstone Deep Miner’s Guild, a Disparian Hunter named Makar, the shopkeeper named Blinsky, Kaster the tavern owner, a pygmy named Alva and the disguised Marinese Knight named Simon.</p>

<p>Dundarrin claims he came to help liberate the city because Lundisian archeologists were encroaching on Cloudstone territory and picking up buried artifacts that they can not control. The rest</p>

<p>A plan is quickly put together. The party believes they could gain access to the barricaded Upper Cathedral Ward with Hubert’s claim to having killed Magnus, the former member of the royal family found at the Circle of Illusion. Dundarrin and the rest plan on intercepting a shipment of magical items they know is heading for the city in a day’s time. The supplies could outfit a small army and help the people liberate their city from the Church and Royal Guard.</p>
