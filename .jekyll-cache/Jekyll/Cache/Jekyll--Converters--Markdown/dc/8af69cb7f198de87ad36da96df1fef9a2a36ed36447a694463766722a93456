I"¸<blockquote>
  <p>You face Pontiff Sulyvahn himself, who has revealed himself as impossibly old and from another world. He wields paired greatswords, one shrouded in flame, the other pulsing with violet energy. He has calmly removed his circlet and rings and set them one by one at the edge of the frozen courtyard fountain. His feet barely seem to touch the ground as he attacks, moving faster and more gracefully than you would think possible, changing direction and seemingly ignoring the momentum of the paired greatswords he twists without a thought.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The party barely survives their second confrontation with Sulyvahn. Ulrach, Lem and Hubert are knocked out. Finally, Isho delivers the killing blow, Sulyvahn whispers, looking past him: â€œNathanielâ€¦ donâ€™t le tthem tell youâ€¦ what you areâ€¦â€</p>

<p>During their fight, a chorus of confused sounds went up all around the city, and without. There was the shouting and fires as the rebellion continued, but also the distant sound of thousands marching without the cities walls. The sound that finally alerts the party that something is wrong is the crashing of great stones coated in flaming oil launched into the city - trebuchets firing from without. His Eye had no access to such tools, so what is this new assault?</p>

<p>The following events happen rapidly - one after the other and with little time to make sense of the situation or respond perfectly. First, Simon appears with a young woman.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Simon smashes through the door of a burning building - the Battle for the Upper Cathedral Ward is in full swing. A pale, thin young woman with dark hair follows behind him, wearing a golden locket. Simon sees you: â€œOh Blessing of the Four Winds, youâ€™re alive. Come, weâ€™ve got to hurry! We have to get her to safety.â€ Here he indicates the young woman behind him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He is attempting to lead the Queen to the distillery and asks for the partyâ€™s help. Hubert excitedly introduces himself to the young royal and tells her that â€œI will be your new Pontiff, if it pleases Her Majesty, and we shall build a new Church for Malorn.â€</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Enter Makar and Dundarrin. Dundarrinâ€™s face and warhammer are slick with blood. â€œAh, there ye are.â€ Makar: â€œIt is not safe here, come with us.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Makar approaches the Queen. Simon suddenly pulls a knife. In a moment of distraction, Dundarrin and Makar attack Simon and the Queen. Rawson tries to stop them but he is not fast enough: Makar swiftly plunges a knife into Queen Maliseâ€™s stomach - once, twice, three times in quick succession. Hubert, crippled as he is, launches himself at Makar and kills him in a rage.</p>

<p>And so the last member of the House Rutvyen, who the people of Lundis believed was the blood of their god Malorn, dies in the cold, surrounded by the ashes of her city.</p>

<p>Dundarrin makes it clear that he is not sorry. â€œWhat these fanatics were afterâ€¦ Cloudstone could not allow it. Disparia agreed. Ours was an alliance of necessity. The surface is for you humans. What lies beneath - your kind â€˜ad best stay out of it.â€</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œWeâ€™ll give you a choice. Youâ€™d a job to do, now youâ€™ve done it. Lundis is done - Disparia and Cloudstone orchestrated all of this, and now Disparia just needs to march through the open gates. You wanted proof that Lundis had been driving a wedge between Marina and Disparia - now you know. Tell King Balin what you saw here. Tell Geoffrey he neednâ€™t worry about White Tower anymore.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>As he says so, a screech is heard high above and far away, followed by two more. After a moment, the sound repeats, closer. And finally, the sound of great wings in the dark night. A dark figure passes over the moon. Its batlike wings are silhouetted against Malornâ€™s Great Eye. And then it breathes fire.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>White Tower is lit up by the red-orange glow of dragon fire. Cries go up throughout the city, not just the Upper Wards. Panic grips the already overwhelmed and confused citizens. You can see now that there are three of them - golden-scaled reptiles soaring high above. The first, larger than the other two, swoops down and emits of blast of fire over the heads of the party.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lem grabs the Mirror and opens his wrist over its surface, covering it with blood. Perhaps the others see him muttering to himself, seeming to negotiate something with his own reflection. There is an eruption of light and electricity in a column a mile high. Out of this display steps Einan, an armless, dark-haired man. He turns to Lem: â€œI want to be clear: I donâ€™t like owing any favors. We are square?</p>
