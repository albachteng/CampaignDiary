  <p>Rawson expires towards dawn, shuddering and drawing his last, ragged breath. His skin has turned a slimy, translucent grey-blue. The light leaves his eyes. In death he stares uncomprehendingly at the water in the small wooden washbasin that relieved his burning flesh for his final night. Ulrach is there with him when he dies.</p>

<p>The party lights a pyre for their lost friend. They investigate their surroundings. The crescent moon continues to disturb Ulrach and Hubert, but they quickly find other problems: strange, crab-like creatures with hollow orbs in place of bodies. They appear as if walking black holes with legs, the edges of their empty shells shimmering slightly. There are many of them, and they emerge from the trees.</p>
