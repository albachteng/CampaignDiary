  <p>It is close to noon by the time Ulrach is captured. You watch from your hiding place - for some, perhaps that is just around the corner of a nearby alley. For others, maybe you managed to scramble up onto the roof of a building, laying down in the ice and snow, shivering as the Royal Guard surround your Minotaur friend. You can hear Hubertâ€™s shout as he leaps onto Ulrachâ€™s back, playing the role of a faithful Church Assassin - perhaps almost too believably. Once he is surrounded, it is only a matter of seconds before there are nearly 20 guards surrounding him. Ulrach is led away in chains. Hubert is apparently accepted as one of them. They march for the Palisade and, ultimately, the Upper Cathedral Ward.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Meanwhile, there are still guards combing the lower wards.</p>

<p>The party takes refuge at Blinskyâ€™s shop and prepare disguises for themselves. With a couple of desperately close calls, they manage to flee the walls of the city and return to <em>The Black Forest</em> tavern, where they find Kaster conversing with some royal guards:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They stand with their backs to you, their hands resting on their weapons, while Kaster stammers through the interrogation. â€œNo milords, havenâ€™t seen any goblins or minotaurs around these parts! Truth be told, wouldnâ€™t know what to do if I did. Werenâ€™t even aware they were allowed near the city, come to think it. Have you tried the Violet Rose? They get all sorts of strange folk down there, not that Iâ€™d know personally, mind. A tavern burnt down you say?â€ His eyes and the quick shake of his head implore you to turn around.</p>
