  <p>Rain and seawater mix in the storm, making every surface of the ship slick. The intermittent lightning offers brief splashes of daylight. The central mast, just struck, hangs suspended at an unnatural angle momentarily before crashing heavily into the water, bringing with it several topmen. Fearful shouts go up all around you as sailors and officers rush to their stations, grabbing swords, crossbows and harpoons, trying to make order from the chaos. Even the most seasoned among them need to latch onto ropes, railings, anything bolted down to prevent tumbling into the crashing waves as the ship reels from one side to the other. At moments, the ship sinks into the valleys between crests and at those times the world becomes almost silent. The creature itself moves without sound, a tentacle slides out from the water and begins groping blindly along the deck, sweeping this way and that, knocking flat the sailors too slow to jump aside. And through it all, the four winds wail against the suddenly miniscule ship, The Gin Mule.</p>
