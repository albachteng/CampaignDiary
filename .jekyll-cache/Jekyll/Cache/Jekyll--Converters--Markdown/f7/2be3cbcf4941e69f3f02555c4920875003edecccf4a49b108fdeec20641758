  <p>After one more uneasy and silent day, _The Gin Mule* puts into port at Lurelin village. It sits on red, sandy shores in the shadow of high cliffs. The fauna is sparse here, and the architecture, what there is of it, is plain clay and stone. The city is walled and the docks have a heavy presence of guards carrying curved swords, halberds, shields and heavy armor, their faces wrapped in a black or red niqab. A sort of mausoleum sits outside the city walls, a squat cylindrical building of cut stone. There are six towers, a half-dozen stories high, situated at each corner of the hexagonal walls. There are perhaps no more than a thousand people in this town.<br /><br />Dominating the view is the entrance to The Rifts. It is hard to tell how far away it is - the scale of the thing confounds your sense of proportion. But it is certainly the largest canyon and cliff-face you have ever seen, certainly taller than the highest tower of Lundis or Chainâ€™s End.</p>
