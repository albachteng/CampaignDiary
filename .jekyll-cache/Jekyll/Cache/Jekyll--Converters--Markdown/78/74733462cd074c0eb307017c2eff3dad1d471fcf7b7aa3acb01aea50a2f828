  <p>From the Trades you are led through the Palisades, past the burnt body of a mage, now frozen solid in place. You are accompanied by first ten and eventually twenty royal guard, all of their faces covered by impassive silver masks. Their leather armor is clean and tightly-fitted. Some of them shake - whether from the cold or from fear of the large bovine monstrosity they have captured is unclear. <br /><br />They move quickly and silently through the streets up to the Eastern Barricade. No one seems to recognize you, or perhaps you manage to blend in with the group. The entire group is quickly given a once-over by the guards for magical items, and then you are given entry to The Upper Cathedral Ward. A long bridge connects the dark facade of the Cathedral to the central White Tower from which the city gets its name.</p>
