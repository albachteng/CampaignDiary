stillness of the air, weighs on you 
oppressively. The sparse cries of seagulls 
punctuate the steady, lazy lapping of waves 
against the ship on which you are passengers. 
The salt air mingles with the sweat of sailors. 
You were hired to protect The Last Word and its 
cargo by a group of Filian Wizards. It is day ten.
