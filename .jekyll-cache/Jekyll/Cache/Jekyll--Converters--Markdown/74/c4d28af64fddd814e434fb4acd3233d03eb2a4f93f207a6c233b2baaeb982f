  <p>Oarsrest sits in the shadow of an enormous mountain, Seawatch. Its high smooth cliffs give the impression of an enormous shield. Compared to Redwater, this is a sprawling metropolis. It lacks the great walls or high stone towers of Redwater, but more than makes up for it in the huge number of homes, shipyards and forges. Its harbor stretches as far as you can see before the coastline curves around towards the north. Everywhere, people are furiously at work in some trade or commerce.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>
