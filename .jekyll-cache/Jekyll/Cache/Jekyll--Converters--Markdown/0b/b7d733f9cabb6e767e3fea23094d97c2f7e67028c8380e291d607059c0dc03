Here the adventurers had their first encounter with the drow, dark-robed humanoids. The drow they fought were infected with a frenzied madness that transformed them into hideous beasts. Ultimately, more - uninfected - drow joined the fray and killed their frenzied brethren before snapping a <em>staff of power</em> to cause the cathedral to collapse.</p>
