I"<p>Circled round with ancient runes and grasped on either side by stone hands, the Mirror was found in the possession of the mage Kolat in the luminous grotto below the Circle of Illusion. Kolat could not discover the mirror‚Äôs secrets.</p>

<p>Rogga told Ulrach it would reveal its secrets if looked at ‚Äúwhere you cannot see.‚Äù</p>

<p>The Mirror of Einan was a prison to Einan the Black for nearly one hundred years. Ulrach and Lem were able to use it to communicate with him. At first, neither party could hear the other, but Einan guided Lem through a blood ritual to allow them to speak.</p>

<p>Einan desired freedom, but was willing to demonstrate to Lem that he could be trusted, granting him powerful advantages against Pontiff Sulyvahn.</p>

<p>The mirror was destroyed and its prisoner released when Lem opened his wrists on its surface and granted Einan permission to escape. In recompense, Einan killed three adult dragons for the party with a nod of his head and promptly disappeared.</p>
