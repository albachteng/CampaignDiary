<p>Trick: Bonus action transforms this saber into a bladed whip, gaining the long-reach property (a 15ft range).</p>

<p>It gains the Arcane property when transformed, allowing you to add your INT modifier to attack and damage rolls.</p>

<p>In the transformed state, you cannot attack enemies within 5ft of you, including attacks of opportunity. You can, however, make attacks of opportunity against opponents who exit your 15ft range.</p>
