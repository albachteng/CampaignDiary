  <p>As the light of the fire dies, a soft glow ignites somewhere deep within the dark reflection of the mirror. The shift of light briefly throws strange shadows off the cracked stone arms wrapped around the edges of the metal frame. For a moment, you might wonder if they moved. But then your eyes are drawn back to the depths of the mirror.</p>

  <p>The clarity of the image adjusts until you can clearly see a small, lavishly decorated and comfortable office room. There is a fireplace in the far corner crackling warmly. On the mantle above it rests a painting of a dragon and a kraken fighting at a storm-tossed sea. The back wall is entirely occupied by a wooden filing system, cabinets and shelves.

<p>The party makes their way through Winndale, a small village to the south of the capital, where Lem, Hubert and Ulrach experience their first taste of the Lundisianâ€™s distaste for non-humans. It is only a dayâ€™s journey to the their destination, so the party pushes forward.</p>
