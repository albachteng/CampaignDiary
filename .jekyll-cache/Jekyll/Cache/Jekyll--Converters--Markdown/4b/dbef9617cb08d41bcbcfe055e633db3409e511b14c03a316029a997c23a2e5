I"0<div>A purplish fluorescent liquid. This fills your frenzy meter but allows you to retain control for up to 10 minutes, at the end of which time, the condition ends and your frenzy is reduced by 1 (leaving you 1 step away from true beasthood). 
<br /><br />You can also voluntarily end the effect as an action. You are partially transformed into a horrifying beast, lycanthropic in form, granting you the following: 
<br /><br />
* Advantage on all Intimidation checks
* Disadvantage on Wisdom, Intelligence and Charisma saving throws
* One extra damage die for any attack you make - this applies only to the regular physical portion of any attacks made
* Vulnerability to silvered weapons and magic attacks
* Resistance to all other forms of damage
* You are one size larger as if affected by the enlarge/reduce spell
* You gain 30ft of movement
* If your frenzy increases by any amount while you are transformed, you must make a Wisdom save against losing control of your character, or else be driven mad by beasthood (ceding control of your character to the DM)
