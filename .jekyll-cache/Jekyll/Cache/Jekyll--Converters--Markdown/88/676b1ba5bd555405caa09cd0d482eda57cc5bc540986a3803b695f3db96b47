  <p>The drow approach the Cathedral and form a ring around it, several hundred yards back. There are dozens and dozens of them, eyes glowing with an intense orange light. They stand stiffly, gazing ahead without understanding or feeling. After a time, the infected drow begin rhythmically pounding their staves, axes and swords against the ground, the sound swelling into a steady beat that echoes off the cavern walls. Out of the darkness beyond steps another blue, tentacled alien creature, dragging behind it the charred corpse of a dwarf - the one left behind. The drow make room for the monstrosity, who steps a few feet forward and, with its bare hands, rips open a hole in the back of the dwarfâ€™s skull and slides something alive and kicking into the cavity of his head. The dwarf stands, eyes glowing bright.</p>

<p>Taking refuge in the cathedral, the party plans its next move and explores their surroundings. Everything about this cathedral reminds them of the bottom of the old well outside Redwater - the wings, the serenely smiling sun. There are stained glass windows depicted old gods.</p>
