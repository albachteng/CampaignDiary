  <p>Before Einan killed them, the dragons shot white-hot streams of flame at the central tower - the city’s namesake. You watched as the spire first tilted, suspended horribly for a moment, before crumbling from its base. Tumbled over in this way, the tower’s destruction bisects the great Cathedral to His Eye and the Upper Cathedral Ward, crushing buildings. Fires spread quickly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You watched as Einan, his shadowy appendages where once were arms, jerks his head, slaying the three great scaled beasts with a thought, saw him smiling and laughing as they and their riders crumpled to the ground. And then he disappeared without a sound.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the burning courtyard, the sounds of screaming, clashing metal and drums in the distance, a great crater where once rested Einan’s Mirror, you stand, perhaps in awe, or in terror, or in disbelief. The Queen lies dead, inches away from her slain killer, Makar. Dundarrin has vanished. Simon is nowhere to be found. The bodies of the enormous dragons are still warm and have collapsed buildings where they fell. The largest is nearly thirty feet from tip to tail, all golden-scaled and crested with twisting horns.</p>
