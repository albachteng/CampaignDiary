<p>The party finds the scattered notes of Kolat in the towers, along with diabolical traps and tricks to keep them from finding him. At the top of an invisible staircase, after a fight with a failed golem, through illusory chambers filled with fire and choked of all air and light, they find a runic symbol that inverts gravity throughout the buildings and allows them to enter the second tower upside down, climbing it, bizarrely, into the depths of the earth‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Where they find Kolat, clutching a mirror in a luminous grotto, with his ‚Äúfaithful servant‚Äù, a ghostly apparition of The Gentleman.</p>
