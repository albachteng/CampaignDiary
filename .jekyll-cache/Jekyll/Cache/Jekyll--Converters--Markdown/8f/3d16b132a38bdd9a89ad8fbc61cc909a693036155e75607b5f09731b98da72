  <p>The Gin Mule is a sailing ship that would make the Wizards of Filia blush with shame. With a crew of only 20, the ship is capable of great speed and maneuverability, as well as bleeding-edge combat capabilities. The Goblins of Mondial in the kingâ€™s employ have worked hard to make certain its ballistas and mangonel are top of the line. It is powerfully fire resistant, iron-clad and at top speeds could ram a lesser ship cleanly in two. In a past life, it was a pirate ship, but like so many pirates, The Gin Muleâ€™s captain chose to come in from the cold and submit to life as a sailor in the Kingâ€™s Service.</p>
