I"H<blockquote>You descend forty feet down the old well, noting the intricate carvings along its edges, matching them to the Lighthouse at the tip of the peninsula Marinal's Call. At its base is a staircase spiraling even further into the depths. The hall to the south is caved in, but to the north you are met with high, stained-glass windows. As you continue your exploration, the ceiling opens up into a high dome. Reflected in the glass, in frescoes, in statues carved into columns, the cathedral's repeating motif is that of a serenely smiling sun and feathered wings.</blockquote>
