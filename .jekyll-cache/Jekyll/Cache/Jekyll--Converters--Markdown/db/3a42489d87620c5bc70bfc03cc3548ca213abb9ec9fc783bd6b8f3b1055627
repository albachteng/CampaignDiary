  <p>You see the lock hours before you reach it. The river cuts into what appears to be a mountain, beyond which shimmers the restless sea. The sun blinds you at first, but the closer you get, the clearer it becomes that the mountain is a city, built in layers around and over the river like a great bridge. A sort of dam has been built into the cityâ€™s sheer face.</p>
