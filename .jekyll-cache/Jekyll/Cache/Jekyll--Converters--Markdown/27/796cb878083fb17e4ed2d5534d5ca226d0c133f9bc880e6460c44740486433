A lonely Watchtower sits at the edge of the Great Forest. You can just barely make out the sound of running water somewhere far beyond it - lost in those trees is the fabled river East Chain. And still further beyond that, the sorcerous Circle of Illusion, your destination. The Au'vanwa shun the Forest. The Marinese fear it. And the Lundisians thrive on its aura of mystery.

<p>The adventurers pass a few more days on the road before arriving at Borean’s Post. The place is little more than a tavern and set of warehouses sitting to the north of the mountain Seawatch. Still, the party manages to win some spending mondy from the goblins playing cards in <em>The King’s Justice</em>. One of the losers mentions the name Ullo - a Goblin artificer in Balnying trying to make a flying machine.</p>

<p><em>The King’s Justice* is a rowdy, quirky bar. Its walls are lined with portraits of every person who has been hung in the market square of Chain’s End. Each portrait bears a name, a date and a crime. Some have nicknames and a few even contain an interesting detail of the hanging, such as “Rope broke twice, had to hang him three times,” or “Fainted. Waited until he regained consciousness.”</em></p>

<p>It isn’t far to the next stopping point, the last before the Great Forest and the Lundisian border. At North Tower, a handful of soldiers share stories and keep their voices low. When asked why they guard the boarder, they only point to the trees. They meet an old, wheelchair-bound Knight of Marina named Merryn, who confesses he was born Lundisian and served as a spy when the Church took over. Hubert and Merryn don’t see eye-to-eye on the state of the Church of Malorn.</p>

<p>Late in the night, the characters can hear the guards sounding the alarms. But by the time they get to the battlements, the fight is over.</p>

<blockquote>
From the battlements, you can see a lone tree burning, maybe a hundred yards from the Tower. It has a harpoon shot through it, and it is bent forward, as if under a great weight. The guards on the battlements each stand with the ballistae loaded, a torch in one hand, ready to ignite the harpoon and fire. The sound of a raven from somewhere within the forest. The soldiers below have gathered their spears and also bear torches. Some clutch small clay jars of oil. They stand in formation, waiting, watching. Minutes tick by, but nothing else moves. Curiously, the tree the soldiers have shot through stands apart from the forest. It wasn’t there before. The wind picks up. You hear the rustle of leaves, the crackling of the fire. The smell of burning wood.
