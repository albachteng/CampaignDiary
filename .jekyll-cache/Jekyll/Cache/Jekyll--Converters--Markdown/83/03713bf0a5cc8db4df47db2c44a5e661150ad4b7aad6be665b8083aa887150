I"¶<p>Sitting outside the northern gate to White Tower, the Open Ring was technically not a part of the city. It was where the non-human and the poorest of the city congregated. Home to brothels, orphanges, tanners and blacksmiths - all the least-desirable trades - The Open Ring was home for the Lundisian misfits and criminals. It is also where the revolutionaries of <em>His Eye</em> plotted their overthrow of the Lundisian Church.</p>
