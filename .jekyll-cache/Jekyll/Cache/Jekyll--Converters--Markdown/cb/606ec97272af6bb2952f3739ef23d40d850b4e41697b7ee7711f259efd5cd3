  <li>One extra damage die for any attack you make - this applies only to the regular physical portion of any attacks made</li>
  <li>Vulnerability to silvered weapons and magic attacks</li>
  <li>Resistance to all other forms of damage</li>
  <li>You are one size larger as if affected by the enlarge/reduce spell.</li>
