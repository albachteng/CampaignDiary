        The heat of the sun, coupled with the 
        stillness of the air, weighs on you 
        oppressively. The sparse cries of seagulls 
        punctuate the steady, lazy lapping of waves 
        against the ship on which you are passengers.

Beldryn dies fighting the monstrosity with <em>The Moonlight Greatsword</em>. The rest of the party is plunged into black waters, and silence.</p>
