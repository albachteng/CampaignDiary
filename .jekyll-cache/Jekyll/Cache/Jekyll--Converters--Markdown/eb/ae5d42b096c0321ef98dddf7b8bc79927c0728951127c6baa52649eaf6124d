<h3>Redwater</h3>
<image src="resources/images/Harbor.jpg"></image>
<aside>The town is abuzz with activity. It sits on the water, wrapping its walls close to the shoreline to surround a modest harbor. Smaller sailing ships lazily drift in and out. A guard tower rises from the water at the end of a stone jetty. In the center of town, an open square appears crowded around a large tavern, smoke pouring from its many high chimneys. The smell of smoked meats and fish fill the air. Closer to the city gate, you can hear the cries of men at work on the walls, and at the forges.

<p>In Redwater, the party splits to seek out supplies and work. With most of their belongings lost in the shipwreck, and with the town overrun by refugees from the nearby farms, finding affordable goods and paying work proves difficult.</p>
