He was noted for his calm demeanor and his absolute trust in Sulyvahn. He fully endorsed the Church‚Äôs political takeover of Lundis, and spoke fondly of ‚Äúthe project‚Äù, which remains a mystery to the adventurers.

High Inquisitor Noska was taken hostage in the medical theater in the Catacombs during Hubert‚Äôs attempt to free Ulrach. His life ended unceremoniously, when Hubert cut his throat to face Pontiff Sulyvahn himself.</p>
