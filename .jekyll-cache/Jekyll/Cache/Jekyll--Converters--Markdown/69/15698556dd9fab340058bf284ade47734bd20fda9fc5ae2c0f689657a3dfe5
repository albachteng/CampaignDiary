A lonely Watchtower sits at the edge of the Great Forest. You can just barely make out the sound of running water somewhere far beyond it - lost in those trees is the fabled river East Chain. And still further beyond that, the sorcerous Circle of Illusion, your destination. The Au'vanwa shun the Forest. The Marinese fear it. And the Lundisians thrive on its aura of mystery.

<p>The adventurers pass a few more days on the road before arriving at Borean’s Post. The place is little more than a tavern and set of warehouses sitting to the north of the mountain Seawatch. Still, the party manages to win some spending mondy from the goblins playing cards in <em>The King’s Justice</em>. One of the losers mentions the name Ullo - a Goblin artificer in Balnying trying to make a flying machine.</p>

<p><em>The King’s Justice</em> is a rowdy, quirky bar. Its walls are lined with portraits of every person who has been hung in the square of Chain’s End. Each portrait bears a name, a date and a crime. Some have nicknames and a few even contain an interesting detail of the hanging, such as “Rope broke twice, had to hang him three times” or “Got loose and broke the executioner’s neck before he could be subdued. Soldiers waited until he regained consciousness to hang him.”</p>
