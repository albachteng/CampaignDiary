I"‘<p>Fist of Lothian: Seemingly a large hunk of metal with finger holes. It is silvered and deals 2d6 bludgeoning damage, and can be wielded in either hand. The weapon crits on 19 or 20 (18, 19 or 20 if you already have an ability that grants criticals on a 19) and stuns the enemy until the end of its next turn when it does. Requires strength of at least 15 to wield. Does not require attunement.</p>
