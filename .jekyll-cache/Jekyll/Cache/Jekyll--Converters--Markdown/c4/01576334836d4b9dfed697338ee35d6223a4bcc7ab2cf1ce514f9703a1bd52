  <p>The smoldering flames of your explosive trap cast dancing shadows through the trees, while the accumulating snow makes the scene washed-out, colorless. After the activity of the brief but intense battle, your breath steadies and your panting and sweating gives way to the deep chill of the northwest hills. A lone raven calls out from somewhere high among the trees. Dundarrin, Makar and Simon finish consolidating the last of the shipment they deem worth taking and hitching the remaining horses to the wagon.</p>

<p>After the battle, Makar converses with Rawson, complimenting his prowess with a bow and proposing that perhaps, when all this is over, the party might consider taking on work from Disparia. Simon informs the party that the ambassador in Lundis has offered the party the use of a hidden vessel off the West Chain to return to Chain’s End.

Within the mirror, Lem sees the same dark-haired figure wearing thick leather gloves, who silently begs Lem to complete the ritual that Ulrach refused. Lem fills a silver cup with his blood (using his silver bell as a makeshift cup) and paint his face with a sheaf of wheat dipped in the chalice. The ritual drains Lem, but it works.</p>

<p>The figure in the mirror begs him to speak. “Who are you?” Lem asks. Tears fill the man’s eyes. “I have not heard another voice… in such a long time.” Lem repeats his question. “I was called Einan.”</p>
