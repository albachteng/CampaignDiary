I",<p>While Geoffrey recovers from the wounds he sustained during the attempt on his life, newly-promoted Captain Heywood Loom and (disguised) Marinese Knight Ada Dalton give the adventurers a thorough debriefing and their gratitude for saving Duke Geoffrey. As Outlanders - folk not from Mondial - they are treated to a lesson in local history.</p>

<p>Marina and Disparia were at war within the last hundred years, and tensions remain high between them. Disparia fought to extend its borders to the sea and to prevent Marina from its (at the time) expansive use of magic. The War of Bays destroyed much of the land north of the Circle of Enchantment but Redwater managed to push the Disparians back into the Bay of Fire before a treaty was finally signed.</p>

<p>The War came to an abrupt end when the Prince of Disparia, Einan the Black, destroyed the Circle of Evocation, which was at the time a state-sponsored school of magic near the capital of Malachi’s Watch. It is said that Einan burnt the Circle to the ground while attempting to summon an evil spirit to destroy Marina.</p>

<p>The Marinese, for their part, agreed to all but shutter the Circle of Enchantment, driving the mages onto an island castle connected by a thin sliver of land. Neither side admitted fault in the wars, but both agreed that they would cease all experimentation into Magic and the study of Artifacts. In this way, the mages were scapegoated for the carnage.</p>

<p>With access to the sea and The Rifts - a great canyon at the East end of Mondial - The Disparians began The Hunt. This was a campaign to exterminate the dragons, and by extension, the Au’vanwa nomads. The Hunters of Disparia are believed to have been successful - no dragons have been seen in Marina for nearly a hundred years. The Au’vanwa survived, slipping between the desert, The Rifts and The Bay of Fire.</p>

<p>Lundis remained relatively quiet during the wars, but took advantage of Marina’s financial difficulties during the fallout. They leased a large piece of land on a cliff overlooking the ocean and founded their own school of magic - the School of Talen. Ostensibly dedicated to the study of the Artifacts and not the practice of magic itself, The School is as far away from Disparia as possible and allows Marina to technically adhere to their agreement to never sponsor a Circle - while still keeping potential weapons within its borders. As to why Lundis would want a piece of land in Marina, it is only known that they needed access to a large body of water.</p>

<p>Lundis has grown over the last hundred years, from little more than a city-state to a full-blown kingdom. Bordered by the Dwarven foothills of Cloudstone to the North and surrounded by the Great Forest on all other sides, it has enjoyed relative stability and peace. They have also dramatically increased their interests in the study of magic and archeology.</p>

<p>There has been a religious awakening in the capital of Lundis. The Church of Malorn, the canonical founder of Lundis, has grown in popularity. It is largely seen as a cult outside of Lundis.</p>

<p>Cloudstone, for its part, does not allow humans within its borders. Their Kingdom is in the northern mountains - literally within them, since the land above ground is icy and desolate. The Dwarves are rarely seen in the human kingdoms except as mercenaries. The Deep Miner’s Guild is the most lethal force that money can buy.</p>

<p>The recent arrival of Goblins in Marina is quickly becoming a political disaster. The famous tinkers have brought with them smokepowder weapons - rifles, explosives and stranger whirring gizmos. Disparians argue that the technology they brought with them from The Deep Roads constitutes magic and therefore violates the treaty between their nations. The Knights of Marina politely disagree and invite the Disparians to come get the weapons themselves if they like.</p>

<p>Of course, Marina is fiercely protective of the technology and is going to great lengths to make the Goblins happy with their situation so that they will not feel compelled to propose trade with any of the other Kingdoms. The Goblins, unfortunately, are rather destructive in their experiments, and do not share the humans’ distrust of magic. They make regular requests to collaborate with the Circle of Enchantment to create even more wonders.</p>

<p>Ada proposes an expedition through the great forests into the Circle of Illusion and White Tower. Having demonstrated themselves perfectly capable of such clandestine operations, she thinks the adventurers would be the perfect hire. Outsourcing the job to non-Marinese also gives King Balin plausible deniability in the event of your capture and torture.</p>

<p>That being said, Ada would not be opposed to finding other suitable work for you. She has been hoping also for someone to infiltrate the School of Talen. Any evidence that they are not keeping strictly to the terms of their lease would likewise give Marina an opportunity to push them off their lands and claim whatever artifacts they are storing as their own - strictly for safekeeping, of course.</p>

<p>If you have other ideas about next steps, Ada is ready to communicate with her superiors to determine a more suitable line of work for you. It’s not every day that Marina finds such capable and reliable adventurers.</p>

<p>Ada admits that she is eager to find out more about the Circle of Illusion for personal reasons. The Duke’s daughter, The Lady Dauphine, fell prey to some sort of curse when she foolishly went exploring in the great forests a year prior. Ada suspects the mages are responsible for whatever was done to her. She is frequently disturbed, distracted and speaks nonsense. Duke Geoffrey would like to speak to you more on this matter, as it is somewhat private.</p>

<p>As to your claims of the dark presence within the earth, Ada is confident that Marina can prevent a repeat of the issue. The drow have been kept off the surface for millennia, mostly thanks to the care of the Knights of Marina. But we’d best not let the people know about their existence, if at all possible. Wouldn’t want to start a panic.</p>
