  <p>It is close to noon by the time Ulrach is captured. You watch from your hiding place - for some, perhaps that is just around the corner of a nearby alley. For others, maybe you managed to scramble up onto the roof of a building, laying down in the ice and snow, shivering as the Royal Guard surround your Minotaur friend. You can hear Hubert’s shout as he leaps onto Ulrach’s back, playing the role of a faithful Church Assassin - perhaps almost too believably. Once he is surrounded, it is only a matter of seconds before there are nearly 20 guards surrounding him. Ulrach is led away in chains. Hubert is apparently accepted as one of them. They march for the Palisade and, ultimately, the Upper Cathedral Ward.<br /><br />Meanwhile, there are still guards combing the lower wards, albeit they are scattered and few by that point. After a while, the activity slows, and it would appear as if fewer guards are left to patrol the lower wards than is normal, so many having left to join the crowd taking the minotaur hostage. Regardless, with a goblin in your party, it might be best to get off the streets.</p>
