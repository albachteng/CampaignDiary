I"/<blockquote>The town is abuzz with activity. It sits on the water, wrapping its walls close to the shoreline to surround a modest harbor. Smaller sailing ships lazily drift in and out. A guard tower rises from the water at the end of a stone jetty. In the center of town, an open square appears crowded around a large tavern, smoke pouring from its many high chimneys. The smell of smoked meats and fish fill the air. Closer to the city gate, you can hear the cries of men at work on the walls, and at the forges.

<p>In Redwater, the party splits to seek out supplies and work. With most of their belongings lost in the shipwreck, and with the town overrun by refugees from the nearby farms, finding affordable goods and paying work proves difficult.</p>

<p>Ulrach and Lemullius discover the strange minority race of Pygmies, neither a halfling nor a gnome, but a dark-skinned humanoid of small stature. Lem receives help in the form of equipment in exchange for information about recent prisoner transfers from Redwater to the Marinese capitol of Chain’s End. He learns that all the recent transfers were Pygmies.</p>

<p>After a vision, Isho explores the open-air Cathedral to the Four Winds, where he witnesses the Marinese worship of “Marina - Our Lady of Storm and Sea - and her child, The Moon.” Although he discovers little else about their religion, it occurs to him that he has seen this face before.</p>

<p>Rawson chats up the locals and is directed to a Tavern - <em>The Tangled Net</em>, where he reunites with the party in time for a brawl, and learns that the people of Redwater are not universally friendly to Outlanders, Mages and the Au’vanwa.</p>

<p>The brawl brings them the attention of Anders Willifort, the Steward of Redwater in the absence of “The Good Duke” Geoffrey. Shipments to and from the nearby Goblin settlement of Balnying have been attacked on the road. Anders suspects locals or Disparians and hires the party to put an end to the attacks. And so the investigation begins.</p>
