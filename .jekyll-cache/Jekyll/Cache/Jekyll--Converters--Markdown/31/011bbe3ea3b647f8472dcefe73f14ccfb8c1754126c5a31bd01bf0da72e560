  <p>The moon hangs low, shimmering in the snow and seeming to brush against the towering spires of White Tower. The city is enormous, and made up of two layers - a lower city surrounding an elevated ward. The lower ring holds featureless houses of wood and stone. Pointed arches, ribbed vaults, flying buttresses and stained glass dominate the architecture of the city above, and over it all is a single building, larger than any of the cities you’ve come across in your time in Mondial. The Great Cathedral to His Eye, House of the Church of Malorn. You have arrived at the City of Saints.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Throughout the lower wards, pinprick lights of lanterns and the warm glow of fires within the city’s homes mingle with the sparkle of snowflakes. The smell and feel of cold, and the sound-dampening effect of ice-coated streets combined with the high pale tower at the city’s heart all together leaves you with a sense of awe and smallness. It is a beautiful city, an impressive, enormous city, and yet on the night you arrive, it is as quiet as the grave.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The whole thing is wrapped in a high stone wall and moat. Approaching from the south, you see only a single bridge crossing that moat, and a thin sheet of ice forming at the top of the still waters. The gate is closed, the portcullis down.</p>

<p>The party makes their way through Winndale, a small village to the south of the capital, where Lem, Hubert and Ulrach experience their first taste of the Lundisian’s distaste for non-humans.</p>
