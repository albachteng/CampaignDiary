Compared to Redwater, this is a sprawling metropolis. It lacks the great walls or high stone towers of Redwater, but more than makes up for it in the huge number of homes, shipyards and forges. Its harbor stretches as far as you can see before the coastline curves around towards the north. Everywhere, people are furiously at work in some trade or commerce.<blockquote>

The company makes for the seediest tavern they can find, tracking the Scholar Melwyn. <em>The Broken Chain</em> sits right off the docks and is full with carousing and gambling sailors.
