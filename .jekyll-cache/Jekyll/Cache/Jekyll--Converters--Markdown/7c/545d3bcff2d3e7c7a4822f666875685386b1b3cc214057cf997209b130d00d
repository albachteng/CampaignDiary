  <p>The door at the end of the road opens into a wide square chamber of polished marble and granite, alternating light and dark tiles. Lit sconces line the chamber. At the far end of the room is a heavy metal door. Above the door, written in Common, are the words: â€œWhatever is required.â€</p>

<p>The Hall of Egress appears to be composed of three rooms with challenges themed after the major gods of Mondialâ€™s pantheon. For Malachi, the chessmaster, the players took the position of chess pieces and attempted to cross the field. When they deviated from the legal path or were â€œcapturedâ€ by their unseen adversary, they were punished with magical lightning and crushing blows from the marble chess pieces.</p>
