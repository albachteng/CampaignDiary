I"‹<p>Seawatch from a distance resembles a tall, smooth shield facing the sea. The town of Oarâ€™s Rest lies in its shadow at dusk, but at dawn the light shines on the cliff face. Far above, you can hear the occasional distant sounds of rumbling and hammering, and see smoke and steam rising from the summit. Lemâ€™s instructions from the Goblins on The Pebble at Chainâ€™s End tell him to look at the base of the mountain for an entrance to the Underdark left hidden and sealed by the Goblins. The under-mountain is filled with dangers and the abandoned mechanisms of the Goblin confederates. According to them, only a Goblin can open the door now.</p>
