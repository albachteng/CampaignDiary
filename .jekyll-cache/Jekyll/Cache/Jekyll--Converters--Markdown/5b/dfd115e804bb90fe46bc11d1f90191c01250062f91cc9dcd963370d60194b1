  <p>The smoldering flames of your explosive trap cast dancing shadows through the trees, while the accumulating snow makes the scene washed-out, colorless. After the activity of the brief but intense battle, your breath steadies and your panting and sweating gives way to the deep chill of the northwest hills. A lone raven calls out from somewhere high among the trees. Dundarrin, Makar and Simon finish consolidating the last of the shipment they deem worth taking and hitching the remaining horses to the wagon.</p>

<p>Dundarrin and Simon take stock of the bounty and hitch the remaining live horses to the wagon, attempting to consolidate as much as possible. Makar converses with Rawson, complimenting his prowess with a bow and proposing that perhaps, when all this is over, the party might consider taking on work from Disparia.</p>
