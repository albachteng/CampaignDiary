I"Y<p>The Knights are a clandestine group, often disguised as beggars or servants, more assassins and spies than proper Knights. In times past, the Knights supplemented their skill at arms with magic, but those arts are lost to the modern Knight. Their weapons and attire are designed to hide their status and equipment rather than display it.</p>
