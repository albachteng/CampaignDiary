I"½<p>The Church of Malorn worships Death and The Moon, said to be His Great Eye, watching over the world. The mythology of Malorn places him as hero to all of humanity, and the first human mage. Stories say that he was born a mortal man, disfigured from birth. His father, an ancient warlord, rejected him for his misshapen figure and dropped him from a tall, pale tower to his death. Malorn lay dead for a time but rose to seek out The Weald, which had enticed him with the beautiful glow of its twilight. 
<br /><br />
Malorn lived long among the Fae and learnt their magic, but he knew he did not belong. The Fae were intrigued by Malorn himself, but repulsed by what they found when they sought out other humans. The light of human souls were hideous in the eyes of the twilight races, and they determined to snuff it out. 
<br /><br />
Malorn convinced the Fae to allow him to return to Mondial. He promised that if they let him borrow their magic, he would make it so that the light of humanity that they found so offensive would never cross their borders again. It is unknown what exactly he did with that magic, but it has ripped Mondial and The Weald apart and set an uncrossable barrier between them.</p>
