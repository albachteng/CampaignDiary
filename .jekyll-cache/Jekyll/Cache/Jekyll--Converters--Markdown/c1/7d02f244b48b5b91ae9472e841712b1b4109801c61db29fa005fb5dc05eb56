I"ã<blockquote>
  <p>It is close to noon by the time Ulrach is captured. You watch from your hiding place - for some, perhaps that is just around the corner of a nearby alley. For others, maybe you managed to scramble up onto the roof of a building, laying down in the ice and snow, shivering as the Royal Guard surround your Minotaur friend. You can hear Hubert‚Äôs shout as he leaps onto Ulrach‚Äôs back, playing the role of a faithful Church Assassin - perhaps almost too believably. Once he is surrounded, it is only a matter of seconds before there are nearly 20 guards surrounding him. Ulrach is led away in chains. Hubert is apparently accepted as one of them. They march for the Palisade and, ultimately, the Upper Cathedral Ward.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Meanwhile, there are still guards combing the lower wards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The party takes refuge at Blinsky‚Äôs shop and prepare disguises for themselves. With a couple of desperately close calls, they manage to flee the walls of the city and return to <em>The Black Forest</em> tavern, where they find Kaster conversing with some royal guards:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They stand with their backs to you, their hands resting on their weapons, while Kaster stammers through the interrogation. ‚ÄúNo milords, haven‚Äôt seen any goblins or minotaurs around these parts! Truth be told, wouldn‚Äôt know what to do if I did. Weren‚Äôt even aware they were allowed near the city, come to think it. Have you tried the Violet Rose? They get all sorts of strange folk down there, not that I‚Äôd know personally, mind. A tavern burnt down you say?‚Äù His eyes and the quick shake of his head implore you to turn around.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After hiding themselves carefully (and a couple of hilariously close calls for Lem, who is wearing stilts to pass as a human) evening finally falls and the party meets with Dundarrin, Makar and Simon, who have brought horses to meet the wagon train in the forests to the north-east. Dundarrin scolds the party for their recklessness and bluntly states that their friends Hubert and Ulrach are likely dead.</p>

<p>During their journey into the forests, the leaders of His Eye discuss plans for storming the Upper Cathedral Ward. Dundarrin is in favor of immediately headint to the distilleries, where healing potions and communion are made - holding them could mean a swift and decisive victory, since it dramatically would limit the Church‚Äôs power to fight back. Makar believes that freeing the Queen should be the first priority - symbolically, it could rally the people to their side. When Isho mentions that the party will want to go in search of their friends first, Simon confides that Alva, the pygmy, is planning on doing just that, and they should therefore join her.</p>

<p>The party sets a careful ambush with Lem setting explosives and hidden ditches in the snow-coated road. Rawson takes the high ground while Dundarrin and Isho prepare to charge in on horseback once the trap is sprung. Three wagons full of supplies are led by eight porters and a rear guard of two monstrously large men, all attired in the garb of the Lundisian Church. The trap works.</p>

<p>After dispatching</p>
