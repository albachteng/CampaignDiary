  <p>Before Einan killed them, the dragons shot white-hot streams of flame at the central tower - the city’s namesake. You watched as the spire first tilted, suspended horribly for a moment, before crumbling from its base. Tumbled over in this way, the tower’s destruction bisects the great Cathedral to His Eye and the Upper Cathedral Ward, crushing buildings. Fires spread quickly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You watched as Einan, his shadowy appendages where once were arms, jerks his head, slaying the three great scaled beasts with a thought, saw him smiling and laughing as they and their riders crumpled to the ground. And then he disappeared without a sound.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the burning courtyard, the sounds of screaming, clashing metal and drums in the distance, a great crater where once rested Einan’s Mirror, you stand, perhaps in awe, or in terror, or in disbelief. The Queen lies dead, inches away from her slain killer, Makar. Dundarrin has vanished. Simon is nowhere to be found. The bodies of the enormous dragons are still warm and have collapsed buildings where they fell. The largest is nearly thirty feet from tip to tail, all golden-scaled and crested with twisting horns.</p>

<p>A series of encounters on their way out of the city, making for the West Chain and the ambassador’s hidden vessel: the city guard abandoning their posts, a dying church assassin crushed by a collapsing building, trebuchet shots narrowly missing the party as they flee.</p>

<p>Like many of the citizens of White Tower, the party takes to the bare hills off the main road leading south from the city. Refugees dot the landscape. Dipping into the forest briefly, the party finds human bones set in a spiral pattern, another warning from the Great Forest.</p>

<p>They arrive in Winndale, the small village already overrun with refugees, a day later. Exhausted from lack of sleep and cold, many are sleeping in barns or begging at houses to be let in. Huddled masses congregate at the gates. Some are constructing makeshift tents from old blankets and branches, building fires. Many took nothing with them when they fled the city.</p>

<p>They are taken in at Raventree Estate, the occupants of which happen to be - surprisingly, in Lundis - elves. The elderly Lady of the manor introduces herself as Baroness Elwyn.</p>
