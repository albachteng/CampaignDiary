  <p>On the horizon, a ship lacking a main mast or flag floats alone. The winds and waters are still today and the seemingly abandoned vessel hardly moves. It is covered in barnacles and ice. When you are close enough, your suspicions are confirmed - it is the ship that brought you first to Mondial. It is The Last Word.</p>

<p>The party brings Hanford/Tzitzik onto the ship with them, winning the permission of the captain despite his protests.</p>

<p>The ship is in ruins - its main mast is broken off, and some members of the party might even remember seeing it fall. The entire thing is coated in ice and salt. They make their way down below and find bodies - dressed like Outlanders, but difficult to identify. Some of them appear to have been eaten. Some have sheets over them.</p>
