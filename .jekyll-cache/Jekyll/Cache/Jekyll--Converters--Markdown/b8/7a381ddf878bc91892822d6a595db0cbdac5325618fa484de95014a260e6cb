I"Ä<blockquote>
  <p>The smoldering flames of your explosive trap cast dancing shadows through the trees, while the accumulating snow makes the scene washed-out, colorless. After the activity of the brief but intense battle, your breath steadies and your panting and sweating gives way to the deep chill of the northwest hills. A lone raven calls out from somewhere high among the trees. Dundarrin, Makar and Simon finish consolidating the last of the shipment they deem worth taking and hitching the remaining horses to the wagon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After the battle, Makar converses with Rawson, complimenting his prowess with a bow and proposing that perhaps, when all this is over, the party might consider taking on work from Disparia. Simon informs the party that the ambassador in Lundis has offered the party the use of a hidden vessel off the West Chain to return to Chain‚Äôs End. Lem accepts a locket from Simon who requests that it be delivered to Abigail, in the employ of Duke Geoffrey. During their travel back to civilization, the Great Forest once again makes its dangers known to the party:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After an hour of travel, you arrive at a strange tableau in the middle of the road. The corpse of a squirrel is placed next to an acorn, followed by (in order) the corpse of a cat, a dog, a wolf, and a bear. Behind the bear, the earth has been upturned and there are strange scuff marks in the snow, as if there had been another corpse behind it, dragged off. From the trees you can hear the calls of an unkindness of ravens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The party moves on quickly and returns to The Open Ring outside the city gates and to <em>The Black Forest</em>. While the others are resting, Lem experiments with the Mirror, discovering that he can use Myca to activate it. Within the mirror, Lem sees the same dark-haired figure wearing thick leather gloves, who silently begs Lem to complete the ritual that Ulrach refused. Lem fills a silver cup with his blood (using his silver bell as a makeshift cup) and paint his face with a sheaf of wheat dipped in the chalice. The ritual drains Lem, but it works.</p>

<p>The figure in the mirror begs him to speak. ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù Lem asks. Tears fill the man‚Äôs eyes. ‚ÄúI have not heard another voice‚Ä¶ in such a long time.‚Äù Lem repeats his question. ‚ÄúI was called Einan.‚Äù</p>

<p>Lem, ever slow to trust, proposes that he can help free Einan from his imprisonment if he can help save his friends. Einan feeds Lem key information that will help the party defeat Sulyvahn, who Einan claims is not human. The long-ago Prince of Disparia also claims that Lundis should be razed to the ground, that the Pontiff‚Äôs plans are unholy and perverse.</p>

<p>The next morning, the party meets with Alva, who helps them re-enter the city with a perfect illusion that confuses the guards. The magic seems to exhaust her and she exhorts the party to remember: ‚ÄúIt always costs something. That‚Äôs what your kind don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù</p>

<p>The revolutionaries provide disguises that roughly mimic the appearance of the royal guard. Once in the sewer system, the party splits off with Alva to seek the Catacombs and, hopefully, their friends.</p>

<p>They find the surgical theater quickly, the catacombs mostly abandoned now that open rebellion has begun above. What they find of their friends is shocking:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The half-elf before you is deformed and broken so horribly that it takes you a moment to recognize him. His crisp and precise leather armor has been exchanged for some loose weave that barely qualifies for a burlap sack. He has been shaven. But worst of all, it is hard to recognize Hubert without his habitual posture - catlike in that it is both alert and relaxed. The reason, you realize, is that he is on the floor. And the next revelation, with horror, is why.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Huberts legs have been broken and healed in the wrong shape, repeatedly. The result is that his legs are bent at several points where they should not be into crumpled and twisted stubs. His only means of locomotion is to drag himself across the floor on his arms. He is crippled.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is hard to say who got the worst of it: Ulrach sits cross-legged facing a corner. Minotaurs were not unheard of among the Bronze Vault of Filia, so you have seen minotaurs with broken horns before - always with a tale of bravery or a rugged fight with some beast. But this is the first time you have seen one whose horns have been completely removed, surgically. A fresh scar and caked blood give Ulrach a capuchin of ruddy brown.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When engaged in conversation, Ulrach speaks distractedly and in strange rhymes. ‚ÄúThe stone man gone to ground, where do you think he is now?‚Äù Hubert explains how he tried to free Ulrach and killed Noska. Patting Ulrach: ‚ÄúThis one I saved.‚Äù The party finds a makeshift</p>

<p>Newly promoted High Inquisitor Narissa finds them and attacks, but is quickly overpowered by the party, even with a group of Assassins at her side. The party emerges into the cold night, shouts going up all around them and fires breaking out, the rebellion in full swing.</p>
