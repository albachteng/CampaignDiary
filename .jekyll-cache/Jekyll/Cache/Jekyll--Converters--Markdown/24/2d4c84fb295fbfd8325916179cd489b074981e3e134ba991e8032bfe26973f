  <p>The smoldering flames of your explosive trap cast dancing shadows through the trees, while the accumulating snow makes the scene washed-out, colorless. After the activity of the brief but intense battle, your breath steadies and your panting and sweating gives way to the deep chill of the northwest hills. A lone raven calls out from somewhere high among the trees. Dundarrin, Makar and Simon finish consolidating the last of the shipment they deem worth taking and hitching the remaining horses to the wagon.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After an hour of travel, you arrive at a strange tableau in the middle of the road. The corpse of a squirrel is placed next to an acorn, followed by (in order) the corpse of a cat, a dog, a wolf, and a bear. Behind the bear are strange scuff marks in the dirt, like there was another corpse behind it. From the trees you can hear the calls of an unkindness of ravens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dundarrin and Simon take stock of the bounty and hitch the remaining live horses to the wagon.</p>
