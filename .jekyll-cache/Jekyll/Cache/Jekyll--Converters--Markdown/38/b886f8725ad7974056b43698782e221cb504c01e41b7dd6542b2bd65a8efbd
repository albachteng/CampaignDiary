  <p>As the light of the fire dies, a soft glow ignites somewhere deep within the dark reflection of the mirror. The shift of light briefly throws strange shadows off the cracked stone arms wrapped around the edges of the metal frame. For a moment, you might wonder if they moved. But then your eyes are drawn back to the depths of the mirror.</p>
