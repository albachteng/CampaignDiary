I"™<p>The party sets sail on <em>The Gin Mule</em>, a former pirate ship conscripted into the service of Marina - a surprisingly common occurrence in the kingdom by the sea. Its captain, Curly Davenport, is an old man but sharp and wry, and an elaborate storyteller.</p>

<p>Apart from Davenport, the party is introduced to a crew of sailors, topmen, mates and medical pursers. Among them is a survivor from the wreck of <em>The Last Word</em> - a man who speaks very little and avoids discussing the attack. Lem also introduces himself to the chief engineer - a goblin named Tzitzik who goes by Hanford Paddle, ostensibly to fit in with the primarily human crew.</p>
