I"Ü<p>‚ÄúThe Wren always follows The Nightingale.‚Äù</p>

<p>Functionally, a pair of +1 daggers. Each deals 1d4+1 damage and has the light, finesse, ad thrown (30/60) properties.</p>

<p>When The Nightingale is thrown, the player can, as a free action, teleport to the location of The Nightingale, as long as s/he is holding The Wren. This does not prompt attacks of opportunity. The user can then attack with the Nightingale - not counting as two attacks or against multi-attack. After teleporting, The Wren is automatically returned to your hand.</p>

<p>Alternatively, The Wren can be thrown, and it will return to the player‚Äôs hand as long as the player is holding The Nightingale in the other hand. Any creature or small item The Wren is stuck in will teleport with it (as long as it can be freely moved, up to DM‚Äôs discretion, this will not move mountains or sections of wall, for example).</p>
