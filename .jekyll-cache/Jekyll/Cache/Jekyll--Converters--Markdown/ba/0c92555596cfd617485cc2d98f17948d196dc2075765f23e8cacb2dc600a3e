  <p><em>The Gin Mule</em> is a sailing ship that would make the Wizards of Filia blush with shame. With a crew of only 20, the ship is capable of great speed and maneuverability, as well as bleeding-edge combat capabilities. The Goblins of Mondial in the king’s employ have worked hard to make certain its ballistas and mangonel are top of the line. It is powerfully fire resistant, iron-clad and at top speeds could ram a lesser ship cleanly in two. In a past life, it was a pirate ship, but like so many pirates, The Gin Mule’s captain chose to come in from the cold and submit to life as a sailor in the King’s Service.</p>

<p>The ship and its crew are full of surprises, but perhaps of great surprise to the party is the sight of Hubert walking up the gangway unassisted. He smiles and offers an ambiguous “Praise Malorn” but otherwise does not explain the sudden restructuring of his legs.</p>

<p>The party sets sail on <em>The Gin Mule</em>, a former pirate ship conscripted into the service of Marina - a surprisingly common occurrence in the kingdom by the sea. Its captain, Curly Davenport, is an old man but sharp and wry, and an elaborate storyteller.</p>

<p>Apart from Davenport, the party is introduced to a crew of sailors, topmen, mates and medical pursers. Among them is a survivor from the wreck of <em>The Last Word</em> - a man who speaks very little and avoids discussing the attack. Lem also introduces himself to the chief engineer - a goblin named Tzitzik who goes by Hanford Paddle, ostensibly to fit in with the primarily human crew.</p>

<p>The first mystery on the ship is the faces - sailors keep finding them carved into the boards of the ship hidden in the corners, under crates and below staircases. The etchings are all precisely the same and knee-height for a medium-sized humanoid, appearing to be either a rune or a picture of a mask, perhaps both. Lem performs a thorough search and erases the runes that he finds.</p>

<p>The second mystery is the ball of blue-green lightning in the distance, bobbing along just above the water, and apparently following the ship from hundreds of meters out. Captain Davenport dsmisses it as “St. Elmo’s Fire” or “Ball Lightning”, a common occurence at sea, he says. Eventually, the strange thing winks out.</p>

<p>But before long, the party reaches Oarsrest, returning to a city that they once fled, to make their way to the mountain called Seawatch. Beneath it, they’ve been told, Lem can find the Fire Elemental he needs to power his new armor.</p>
