I"ô<p>â€œGoblin Townâ€ to those who canâ€™t bother to pronounce it. 
Its name means â€œGift of Fireâ€ and it is known as the largest 
settlement of the otherwise underground-dwelling people 
called Goblins. It is most-well known for being regularly 
burnt to the groun by the eccentric experiments of its 
populace, who are devout tinkers. Redwater residents tell 
the party that Knights have been dispatched from Chainâ€™s 
End to keep an eye on the continued development of dangerous 
weaponry.</p>
