  <p>On the horizon, a ship lacking a main mast or flag floats alone. The winds and waters are still today and the seemingly abandoned vessel hardly moves. It is covered in barnacles and ice. When you are close enough, your suspicions are confirmed - it is the ship that brought you first to Mondial. It is The Last Word.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The party brings Hanford/Tzitzik onto the ship with them, winning the permission of the captain despite his protests.</p>

<p>The ship is in ruins - its main mast is broken off, and some members of the party might even remember seeing it fall. The entire thing is coated in ice and salt. They make their way down below and find bodies - dressed like Outlanders, but difficult to identify. Some of them appear to have been eaten. Some have sheets over them.</p>

<p>On the orlop deck, Ulrach searches the officer’s quarters and finds Martin, the first mate, frozen and dead, his sword in his hand, an old greatsword. On the wall, the phrase “blacken the moon” has been carved into the walls. Elsewhere they find the mask-rune and “awaken” written in blood. In another room they find a family of corpses huddled together, barricaded together in their room.</p>

<p>They proceed to the final level, the cargo hold. Here they find that much of the cargo has been untouched - there are explosives, oil, elixirs, quickening - enough to outfit a regiment.</p>

<p>Their goblin captive points to the bodies: “Look at their faces. He’s coming.” Hubert bends over to inspect one, its face has been completely peeled off. As he does so, the corpse sinks its teeth into his neck.</p>
