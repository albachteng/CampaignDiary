  <p>The stone castle rises straight out from the water. A long narrow land bridge connects it to the shore at low tide, but right now it is flooded. Its most peculiar feature is the central telescope peeking out from the battlements above the highest tower. Davenport gives the command to drop anchor at some distance due to choppy waters and the threat of rocks near the surface. First Mate Wheatley offers to row you and Gerrth to the fortress.</p>
