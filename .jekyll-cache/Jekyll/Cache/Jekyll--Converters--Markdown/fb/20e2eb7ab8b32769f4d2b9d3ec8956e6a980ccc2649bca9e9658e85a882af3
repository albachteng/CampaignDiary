In the darkness, a blue spark crackles into life. And then another. You trace the arc of energy around a globe, the size of a cannonball. The light reveals sunken, hollow eyes, black hairs charging with static. A long, sinuous, feline body of bone, a wrinkled skull for a head, and everywhere, thick black hair and bright, blue lightning. It draws its grinning skull in near, flashes bright, and then vanishes again into the night. Somewhere in the blackness, you hear and feel the resonance of a deep, rolling purr.
