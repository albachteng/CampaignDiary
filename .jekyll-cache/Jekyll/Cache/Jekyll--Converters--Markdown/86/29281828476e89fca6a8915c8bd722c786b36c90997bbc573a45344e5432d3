I"7<blockquote>
    The heat of the sun, coupled with the 
    stillness of the air, weighs on you 
    oppressively. The sparse cries of seagulls 
    punctuate the steady, lazy lapping of waves 
    against the ship on which you are passengers. 
    The salt air mingles with the sweat of sailors. 
    You were hired to protect The Last Word and its 
    cargo by a group of Filian Wizards. It is day ten.

Our party of adventurous mercenaries notice strange
behavior from water elementals, as well as an unusual
bioluminescent algae bloom in the waters as night approaches.
The Wizard Oneth of Filia, revealed some of the precious cargo
<em>The Last Word</em> carries, which includes several "Candidates", rare magical Artifacts: a silvery greatsword, a pair of daggers
given the name <em>The Wren and the Nightingale</em> and a mace 
with a bell-shaped head.

<em>The Last Word</em> meets its apparent end shortly thereafter. 
The ship is attacked by monstrous crabs with hooded human torsos. A kraken emerges from the depths. Behind its beak, Isho witnesses a serenly smiling face. Beldryn dies fighting the monstrosity with <em>The Moonlight Greatsword</em>. The rest of the party is plunged into black waters, and silence.
