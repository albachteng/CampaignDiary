I"ã<p>‚ÄúThe Wren always follows The Nightingale.‚Äù</p>

<p>Functionally, a pair of +1 daggers. Each deals 1d4+1 damage and has the light, finesse, ad thrown (30/60) properties.</p>

<p>When The Nightingale is thrown, the player can, as a free action, teleport to the location of The Nightingale once per round, as long as s/he is holding The Wren. This usage not leave the bearer open to attacks of opportunity. The user can additionally make a follow-up attack with the Nightingale for free - not counting as two attacks or against the multi-attack ability. After teleporting, The Wren is automatically returned to your hand.</p>

<p>Alternatively, The Wren can be thrown, and it will return to the player‚Äôs hand as long as the player is holding The Nightingale in the other hand. Any creature or small item The Wren is stuck in will teleport with it as long as it can be freely moved, at the DM‚Äôs discretion - it cannot move mountains or sections of a wall, for example.</p>

<p>Lem got these weapons from the Wizard Oneth on <em>The Last Word</em> and has been using them ever since. He even let Hubert wield them briefly, when his legs were destroyed.</p>
