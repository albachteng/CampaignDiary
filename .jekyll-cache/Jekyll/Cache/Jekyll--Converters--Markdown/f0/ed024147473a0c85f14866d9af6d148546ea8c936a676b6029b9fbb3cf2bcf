    A hush falls over the party-goers. A loud pop and fading whine soars up into the midnight sky. After a moment of silence there is a crackle and a series of multicolored explosions light up the garden, casting long shadows against the Duke’s Estate. Red, blue, green and yellow fires in the shapes of flowers, shooting stars and glittering suns are painted across the sky as more and more fireworks are launched into the air. The crowd gasps and applauds. For many, it is the first time in their lives that they have seen such a display. A moment later, the screaming begins.

<p>After being held in the Magistrate’s offices for hours, Anders has the party stripped of their weapons and thrown into a cell. Rather than listening to the party’s discoveries in the sunken cathedral, Anders insists that Disparia is behind the attacks and that the party are liars (true) and spies (not true). Thanks to Lem’s quick thinking, the rogue manages to keep hold of his thieves’ tools. But it is the return of the mysterious and furtive Pygmies that saves the party and puts them on the path to save the Duke Geoffrey. Donning magical masks, the party sneaks into a garden party at the Duke’s estate.</p>

<p>At the party, the group splits up to find their equipment and replace Anders at the card table to keep an eye on the Duke. Ulrach learns of the Duke’s disturbed daughter, the Lady Dauphine, who speaks in strange fables. Lem observes strange behavior from some of the guests. Rawson and Isho keep watch for the assassination attempt and discover a strange circle of runes in the attic.</p>

<blockquote>
    The card tables in the dining room shudder. They lift off from the ground and suddenly they are towering over the players. The legs quiver and soften into sludge and the flat tops break apart into a gaping, toothy maw, a long purple tongue and foul, poisonous breath. 
</blockquote>

<p>The party is quick to act, as are Captain Loom of the Marinese army and Ada Dalton, ostensibly tutor to the Lady Dauphine. They defend the Duke, who takes a few hits in spite of their efforts, while the rest of the party focuses down the mimics. Simultaneously, the nearby string quartet rise in unison and the illusion falls away as the party sees that the musicians were truly a single man, a mage, and an Illusionist. After dispatching the massive, poisonous table-mimics, Rawson chases after the mage outside into the fleeing crowd. He grabs the first person he sees and turns them to face him - but finds only a Redwater resident. He tries another - with the same results. With mounting dread, the party realizes that such a mage could be anyone, anywhere - invisible, disguised or spirited away. He is gone.</p>

<p>They return, with Captain Loom, to the cell where they left Anders. What they find there is shocking.</p>

<blockquote>
    A strange gentleman in elegant attire of gold and bright green stands over the bloodied corpse of Anders Willifort, sometime Steward of Redwater. His throat has been slashed as if viciously torn open by teeth and claw. The gentleman is wiping his blood-stained hands on a soft white handkerchief as you approach. His bright eyes give off an eerie, golden light. Stranger still, however, are his horns - the curved horns of a ram. He is not an elf. He is not a minotaur. He is not a dragonborn. He is something in between them all. He smiles in a manner that, were it not for the circumstances, might be entirely disarming. 
</blockquote>

<p>The gentleman disappears in a flutter of wings as dozens of ravens screech through the iron bars of Redwater’s cells.</p>

<p>Invited by Duke Geoffrey and Captain Loom to remain awhile at the Redwater estate, the party now rests, researches and plans their next move. Increasingly, the signs point to Lundis as likely instigator of the assassination and the framing of Disparia. Lundis and the Circle of Illusion have kept to themselves for a hundred years within the Great Forest. And so becomes our adventurer’s destination.</p>
