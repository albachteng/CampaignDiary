  <p>The Gin Mule is a sailing ship that would make the Wizards of Filia blush with shame. With a crew of 20, the ship is capable of great speed and maneuverability, as well as bleeding-edge combat capabilities. The Goblins of Mondial in the king’s employ have worked hard to make certain its ballistas and mangonel are top of the line. It is powerfully fire resistant, iron-clad and at top speeds could ram a lesser ship cleanly in two. In a past life, it was a pirate ship, but like so many pirates, The Gin Mule’s captain chose to come in from the cold and submit to life as a sailor in the King’s Service. Pirates that do so are frequently given clemency or allowed to work off any remaining debt. Indeed, life as a sailor under the King of Marina is considered by many a Pirate as a safe retirement fund.</p>
