Entering into the forest has the effect of silencing the world. Even the wind goes quiet. All is still. You sense, rather than see, the trees pressing in against you, closing ranks. The dense, murky smells of moss and earth overwhelm your senses. In the stillness, a single, repetitive sound emerges: your own heartbeat. These woods fill you with dread and foreboding. 

Less than an hour in, you stumble upon the first corpse, its back against a tree, lying with arms spread open, its vacant eye sockets lifted skyward. It is little more than a skeleton now.

<p>The Forest plays its tricks. The party wanders for days. They get lost, hear voices and the faint ringing of bells and at one point wake up to find that all of the luggage has been carefully unpacked and placed around their camp in a spiral pattern, organized by size and color. The party loses time - an entire day passes without making any progress as they become entranced by a caterpillar crawling along a branch. At night, unblinking eyes watch them from just beyond the fire’s dim light.</p>

<p>The party has their first encounter with a golem in a collapsed dungeon entrance - an enormous monstrosity of clay. After failing to damage it, the party flees further into the woods. They hear wolves crying. They make the mistake of harming a tree and find themselves battling an endless army of living plants, and must flee again. They find doll replicas of themselves sitting on the forest floor.</p>

<p>Finally, they meet a friendly face - a ruddy, wild, unkempt face. Rogga the dwarf, covered in soot and ravenously digging his crooked teeth into a squirrel he has killed, invites them to share his fire.</p>

<p>He speaks haltingly, as one unaccustomed to speech, and has a habit of smiling and nodding while he says “no.” He talks abstractly of people who are not there: “Raven Man” and “Brother Mountain” and “Horny Queen”. When asked for guidance, he stands, stomps his foot once, and a raised mound of earth snakes along the earth and into the distance, dodging through trees to create a rudimentary path. He warns them not to step away from it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the party does not heed his warning. Hubert and Ulrach are quickly lost in the fogs and dense underbrush when a gibbering mouther - a fleshy abomination of eyes and mouths wrapped</p>
