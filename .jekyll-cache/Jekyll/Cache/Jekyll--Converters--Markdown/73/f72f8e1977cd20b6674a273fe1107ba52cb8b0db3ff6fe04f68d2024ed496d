  <p>Rawson expires towards dawn, shuddering and drawing his last, ragged breath. His skin has turned a slimy, translucent grey-blue. The light leaves his eyes. In death he stares uncomprehendingly at the water in the small wooden washbasin that relieved his burning flesh for his final night. Ulrach is there with him when he dies.</p>
