  <p>The sound of the heavy door slamming behind you reverberates against stone walls. From beyond, you can hear the inhuman sounds of the shrieking, malformed flies and glowing centipedes as the fire overtakes the hanging gardens. The smell of smoke rises faintly from the edges of the door. At first, you feel hammering rattle its hinges, but it ends suddenly. A moment later, you can hear the hanging bridges crumble and crash to the cavern floor.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the Deep Roads apparently carved these rooms and tunnels from the solid rock. They extend for miles in every direction, a network of spartan living quarters, storage, lichen farms, animal pens and even underground springs.</p>

<p>Periodically, the party is attacked in magical darkness by the mazeâ€™s defenders. They take a hit-and-run tactic but are foiled by Rawsonâ€™s superior vision. Ultimately, the party manages to catch one alive.</p>

<p>They are called drow on the surface, but the captive resembles humanity more than expected. Its language is a patois of Goblin, Auâ€™vanwa and something older still. Between Lem and Ulrach, a rudimentary interrogation is performed that gives them a way out of the maze. By rolling enormous barrels of smokepowder to a barricaded door, they blast their way out of the settlements.</p>

<p>Beyond the dis an endless staircase, crossing back and forth over a cliff face. The drow emerge from the settlements to try and stop them.</p>
