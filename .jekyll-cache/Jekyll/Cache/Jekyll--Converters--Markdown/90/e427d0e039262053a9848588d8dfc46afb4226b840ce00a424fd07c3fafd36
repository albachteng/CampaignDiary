  <p>Entering into the forest has the effect of silencing the world. Even the wind goes quiet. All is still. You sense, rather than see, the trees pressing in against you, closing ranks. The dense, murky smells of moss and earth overwhelm your senses. In the stillness, a single, repetitive sound emerges: your own heartbeat. These woods fill you with dread and foreboding. <br /><br />Less than an hour in, you stumble upon the first corpse, its back against a tree, lying with arms spread open, its vacant eye sockets lifted skyward. It is little more than a skeleton now.</p>
