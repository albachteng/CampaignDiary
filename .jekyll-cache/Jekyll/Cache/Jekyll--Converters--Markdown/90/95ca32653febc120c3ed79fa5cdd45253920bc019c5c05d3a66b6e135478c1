  <p>The door at the end of the road opens into a wide square chamber of polished marble and granite, alternating light and dark tiles. Lit sconces line the chamber. At the far end of the room is a heavy metal door. Above the door, written in Common, are the words: ‚ÄúWhatever is required.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Hall of Egress appears to be composed of three rooms with challenges themed after the major gods of Mondial‚Äôs pantheon. For Malachi, the Chessmaster, the players took the position of chess pieces and attempted to cross the field. When they deviated from the legal path or were ‚Äúcaptured‚Äù by their unseen adversary, they were punished with magical lightning and crushing blows from the marble chess pieces.</p>

<p>For Marinal, the party needed to dive into murky waters to flip a switch that would open the way forward. The waters were occupied by an aboleth, which poisoned Rawson. Above the exit to this room, in Common, are inscribed the words: ‚ÄúDown to go up.‚Äù</p>

<p>The final room, apparently Malorn‚Äôs, held only a single basin of water sitting in the center of the room. Within the water, a single stone button. When pressed, a timer began counting down above the locked door - the only way forward. As the timer passed ten seconds, the lights went out and the timer glowed an angry orange color. The characters press the button again frantically, resetting the timer. After much hemming and hawing, the characters finally allow the timer to drop below 5. Lights flashed red as the timer struck zero‚Ä¶</p>

<p>And then the torches sprang back into life. The door forward opened. They could see now above it, written in Common: ‚ÄúShow your humanity.‚Äù</p>

<p>They exit the Deep Roads into the blinding light of Mondial‚Äôs surface. They take an evening to rest at a kindly woodcutter‚Äôs home. In the evening, Ulrach and Hubert are shocked to discover an anomaly in the sky: a crescent moon hanging low. But in Mondial, the moon never waxes or wanes. It has always been full. Yet their hosts show no concern.</p>

<p>Rawson‚Äôs illness advances. He becomes desperate for water, moisture, anything. Ulrach stays awake the night, pouring water over Rawson‚Äôs shivering form. Towards dawn, Rawson shudders, draws his last breath, and dies.</p>
