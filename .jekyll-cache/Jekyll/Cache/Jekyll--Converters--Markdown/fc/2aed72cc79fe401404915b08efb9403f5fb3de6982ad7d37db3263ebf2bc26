  <p>You awake in near-darkness. Smoldering ashes cast long, thin, faint shadows away from camp. Along the walls, swirling patterned grooves cut into the stone form a channel for a creeping luminous moss. The effect is like a faintly yellow glowing calligraphy coating the walls and ceilings of the wide hallway. Rogga described this place as a road. It is large and wide enough to accommodate a grown dragon. Torchlight barely reaches from one end to the other. Camped, as you are, at the crossroads, the enormity of the Deep Roads becomes apparent.</p>

  <p>And so: North to Malachiâ€™s Watch, South to Chainâ€™s End, or West to White Tower.</p>

<p>In the depths below the collapsed grotto, the party again encounters Rogga, who welcomes them to the Deep Roads.</p>

<p>Hubert sets the tone by standing by the West road. The others agree: Lundis is their destination. In the dark depths, they discover the strange remnants of a long-buried civilization:</p>

<ul>
  <li>statues to unfamiliar gods, a robed figure masked by a serenely smiling sun</li>
  <li>luminous fungus of a new variety, bright blue and forming circles on the walls</li>
  <li>drow chanting while facing t</li>
</ul>
