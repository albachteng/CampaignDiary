I"ÿ<p>The Knights are a clandestine group, often disguised as beggars or servants, more assassins and spies than proper Knights. In times past, the Knights supplemented their skill at arms with magic, but those arts are lost to the modern Knight. Geoffrey himself was a Knight once as well - which explains why his armor remains in the attic. Their weapons and attire are designed to hide their status and equipment rather than display it.</p>

<p>The largest change to her order has come out of the recent arrival of Goblins, which is quickly becoming a political disaster. Disparians argue that the technology they brought with them constitutes magic and therefore violates the treaty between their nations. The Knights politely disagree and invite the Disparians to come get the weapons themselves if they like.</p>

<p>Of course, Marina is fiercely protective of the technology and is going to great lengths to make the Goblins happy with their situation so that they will not feel compelled to propose trade with any of the other Kingdoms. The Goblins, unfortunately, are rather destructive in their experiments, and do not share the humansâ€™ distrust of magic. They make regular requests to collaborate with the Circle of Enchantment to create even more wonders.</p>

<p>The technology the Goblins are promising is earth-shaking for the humans: genuine steam engines, a machine for exploring the ocean depths, a machine capable of flight, electric lights, improved buildings. Some Goblins even propose that they could get high enough in the sky to reach the moon if they could collaborate with more magic-users. But Marina knows that such collaboration would mean a likely war with Disparia. And then there is the possibility of such equipment getting in the hands of Marinaâ€™s enemies.</p>

<p>King Balin, drunkard and fool that he is, is mostly preoccupied with a plague in Chainâ€™s End, which has resulted in the city being closed. But it would be foolish to think that Disparia and Lundis will wait for another opportunity like the chaos currently facing Marina. And the citizens of Midcopse, noting the strange environmental impacts ofâ€¦ whatever is going on at the School of Talenâ€¦ are pushing for an end to the lease of Marinese land to Lundis.</p>

<p>And so we come to the recent attack on Geoffreyâ€™s life. A staunch voice of reason and compromise in Chainâ€™s End, Geoffreyâ€™s death could very well tip the balance of power in Parliament towards all-out war with Disparia. It is now clear that this is exactly what Lundis wants. The question is why, and the answer seems clear to Ada Dalton: they want the Goblin Technology for themselves.</p>

<p>Ada proposes an expedition through the great forests into the Circle of Illusion and White Tower. Having demonstrated yourselves perfectly capable of such clandestine operations, she thinks your team would be the perfect hire. Outsourcing the job to non-Marinese also gives King Balin plausible deniability in the event of your capture and torture.</p>

<p>The job would pay handsomely: 1000 gold pieces per person upon your successful return to Chainâ€™s End with any proof of Lundisian acts of war, as well as any evidence that the Circle of Illusion is, in fact, under the direct control of White Tower. With luck, Marina can avoid war with Disparia long enough to convince Malachiâ€™s Watch that they have a common enemy in Lundis.</p>

<p>That being said, Ada would not be opposed to finding other suitable work for you. She has been hoping also for someone to infiltrate the School of Talen. Any evidence that they are not keeping strictly to the terms of their lease would likewise give Marina an opportunity to push them off their lands and claim whatever artifacts they are storing as their own - strictly for safekeeping, of course.</p>

<p>If you have other ideas about next steps, Ada is ready to communicate with her superiors to determine a more suitable line of work for you. Itâ€™s not every day that Marina finds such capable and reliable adventurers.</p>

<p>Ada admits that she is eager to find out more about the Circle of Illusion for personal reasons. The Dukeâ€™s daughter, The Lady Dauphine, fell prey to some sort of curse when she foolishly went exploring in the great forests a year prior. Ada suspects the mages are responsible for whatever was done to her. She is frequently disturbed, distracted and speaks nonsense. Duke Geoffrey would like to speak to you more on this matter, as it is somewhat private.</p>

<p>As to your claims of the dark presence within the earth, Ada is confident that Marina can prevent a repeat of the issue. The drow have been kept off the surface for millennia, mostly thanks to the care of the Knights of Marina. But weâ€™d best not let the people know about their existence, if at all possible. Wouldnâ€™t want to start a panic.</p>
