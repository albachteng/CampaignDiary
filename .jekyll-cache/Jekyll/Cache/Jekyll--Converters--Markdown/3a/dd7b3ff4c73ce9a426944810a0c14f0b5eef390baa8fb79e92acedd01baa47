  <p>Seawatch from a distance resembles a tall, smooth shield facing the sea. The town of Oar’s Rest lies in its shadow at dusk, but at dawn the light shines on the cliff face. Far above, you can hear the occasional distant sounds of rumbling and hammering, and see smoke and steam rising from the summit. Lem’s instructions from the Goblins on The Pebble at Chain’s End tell him to look at the base of the mountain for an entrance to the Underdark left hidden and sealed by the Goblins. The under-mountain is filled with dangers and the abandoned mechanisms of the Goblin confederates. According to them, only a Goblin can open the door now.</p>

  <p>The door is cut into the rock face so precisely that if you weren’t looking for it, you might never find it. It is a crude door, but as Lem approaches, he can see a rough message etched into the stone - a mixture of Goblin code, undercommon and transcribed thieves’ cant. Lucky for the party, Lem is perfectly positioned to make sense of it.</p>

<p>Seawatch is a dormant volcano - abundantly and immediately apparent to the party after wandering through sweltering crevices and the red-orange glow of lava flows. The party faces heavily-armed knights, their weapons and armor singed black with soot, that attack over a narrow bridge suspended above the hot chasm above the caldera.</p>

<p>Lem leads the party into a wide open space filled with crumbling structures half-sunk in lava. The room also features hanging walkways and some sort of chain-and-pully system on a conveyor belt above their heads.</p>
