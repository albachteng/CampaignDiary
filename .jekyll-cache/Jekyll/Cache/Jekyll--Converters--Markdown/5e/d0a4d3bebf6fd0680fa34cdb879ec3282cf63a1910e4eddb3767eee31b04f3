  <p>You see the lock hours before you reach it. The river cuts into what appears to be a mountain, beyond which shimmers the restless sea. The sun blinds you at first, but the closer you get, the clearer it becomes that the mountain is a city, built in layers around and over the river like a great bridge. A sort of dam has been built into the city’s sheer face.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Enormous gates seal off the river at all sides near the wall. As your ship approaches, those gates slide up and out as waves of water empty into the dam from the shaft. Briefly, your boat is pushed back by the force of water emptying out of the lock. The boat spins in place, the river’s mighty current slowed for a time. Finally, when the elevator is empty, the captain directs the boat through this narrow passage into the shaft.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can hear and feel the turning of enormous gears, the flow and drip of water being pumped into the chamber as the door is sealed behind you. The water rises, imperceptibly slow at first, and then in a great burst of engineering might, you are lifting, up, up, up, hundreds of feet into the air above the city walls, above the clustered homes and towers at its base, above the spires of its churches. At the top of the lock, your boat peeks over the high walls of the elevator and you can see blue sky all around you, blue water far below, and the gates swing open to empty your ship into a narrow channel that makes up the roadways of the highest level of the Castle at Chain’s End.</p>

<p>The party is greeted by Duke Geoffrey, Captain Heywood Loom and Knight Ada Dalton. They are also surprised to see Hans, a cauliflower-eared ruffian who fought Ulrach in a bar in Redwater, way back when. Hubert is separated from the rest of the group and placed under house arrest - over the party’s vigorous protest. As a self-professed Assassin of the Church, he is considered a security threat, even without the ability to walk.</p>

<p>Each member of the party is individually debriefed. The party chooses not to tell Chain’s End about Hubert’s assassination of Magnus, nor about Rogga, nor of the Mirror. They pass their checks, are paid handsomely, and invited to meet with the King himself.</p>

<p>King Balin is, unfortunately, a mess of a man. When he arrives he is deep into a bottle of something strong, smoking heavily and absolutely reeking. He is a bear of a man, and in spite of his apparently reckless lifestyle appears strong enough to rip a man to pieces. There is some back-and-forth banter as the King investigates the fall of White Tower and finally he offers the party additional work.</p>

<p>The job is to reach out to the five Au’vanwa tribes and secure their cooperation with Marina to attack and sabotage Disparia from within. A ship will be leaving in a fortnight, and the party is charged with accessing the deep deserts by way of scaling The Rifts, an enormous canyon to Disparia’s east. There will be a substantial bonus for any additional damage the party can do while there. Disparian wealth and supply chains rely heavily on mined ore from eastern desert cities, as well as massive infrastructure in the form of the aqueducts.</p>

<p>In the end, the party is granted free reign of the city, even Hubert (after much negotiation).</p>

<p>The party spends their money and their down-time in the city of Chain’s End. Until recently, it was locked down due to a plague, and the party begins plans to help on that front - Myca suggests placing them near the center of the infection’s outbreak (in the city’s dungeons) so that they can do their job as a node maintainer.</p>

<p>Lem heads out to The Pebble, paying a steep prive for the information that he is being hunted by a pygmy that holds a grudge against him. On the pirate island, he contracts some fellow Goblins for the plans for an armor upgrade, which will require him to find a fire elemental to power it. Here he also takes on the services of a pygmy mage who claims she can heal Hubert and Ulrach in exchange for helping her to free a captive in Marina’s dungeons.</p>

<p>Hubert attemps to spread the word of Malorn to the pygmies, who seem to already worship him as well as the other major gods of the Mondial pantheon, although their interpretation of the gods is radically different from anything Hubert has seen before.</p>

<p>Isho struggles with visions of burning citizens - something only he can see. Ulrach speaks with the Lady Dauphine, attempting to understand their shared madness.</p>

<p>And finally, Rawson. His city adventure begins with a request by the local blacksmith, Alin, to look in on a man who the neighbors claim is a werewolf. Every night they hear howling from his home, but no injuries or deaths to speak of. Rawson heads to The Bridge and begins a stakeout. He hears sobbing and then howling from within. He breaks in…</p>

<p>And discovers a normal wolf, cowering under the bed and whining. It does not appear to be a lycanthrope. Confused, Rawson waits with the beast until morning, when it turns into a man. The man introduces himself as Gerth and explains that he used to live near the Circle of Illusion, but was cursed by a mage when he killed a man. He was not proud to kill the man, but his family needed food, Gerth explains…</p>

<p>Rawson asks what he remembers from before being cursed.</p>
