  <p>You face Pontiff Sulyvahn himself, who has revealed himself as impossibly old and from another world. He wields paired greatswords, one shrouded in flame, the other pulsing with violet energy. He has calmly removed his circlet and rings and set them one by one at the edge of the frozen courtyard fountain. His feet barely seem to touch the ground as he attacks, moving faster and more gracefully than you would think possible, changing direction and seemingly ignoring the momentum of the paired greatswords he twists without a thought.</p>

<p>The party barely survives their second confrontation with Sulyvahn. Ulrach, Lem and Hubert are knocked out. Finally, Isho delivers the killing blow, Sulyvahn whispers, looking past him: ‚ÄúNathaniel‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt le tthem tell you‚Ä¶ what you are‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>

<p>During their fight, a chorus of confused sounds went up all around the city, and without. There was the shouting and fires as the rebellion continued, but also the distant sound of thousands marching without the cities walls. The sound that finally alerts the party that something is wrong is the crashing of great stones coated in flaming oil launched into the city - trebuchets firing from without. His Eye had no access to such tools, so what is this new assault?</p>

<p>The following events happen rapidly - one after the other and with little time to make sense of the situation or respond perfectly. First, Simon appears from one of the burning buildings with a young woman who he identifies as the Queen. He is attempting to lead her to the distillery and asks for the party‚Äôs help. Hubert excitedly introduces himself to the Queen and tells her that ‚ÄúHe will be her new Pontiff, if it pleases Her Majesty, and we shall build a new Church for Malorn.‚Äù</p>

<p>Dundarrin and Makar appear from another direction. Makar approaches the Queen and Simon suddenly pulls a knife. In a moment of distraction,</p>

<p>Halfway through the fight, Lem grabs the Mirror and opens his wrist over its surface, covering it with blood. Perhaps the others see him muttering to himself, seeming to negotiate something with his own reflection.</p>
