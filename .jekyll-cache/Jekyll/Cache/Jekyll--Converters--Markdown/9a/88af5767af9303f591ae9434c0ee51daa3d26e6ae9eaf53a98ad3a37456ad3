  <p>You hear a low hum from outside which quickly ramps up into a sustained chorus erupts all around you. Even the Lundisian you were just speaking with stops talking and bursts into a sustained “aahhh” sound. You realize suddenly that all about the city of White Tower, every single man, woman and child has stopped what they are doing to turn towards the pale tower at the Cathedral’s center, bow and chant a hymn. It brings activity in the city to a complete halt and the very floor beneath your feet resonates with the chorus. The singers drone a series of sentences in a language that resembles little that you have heard before, although Ulrach will recognize a few au’vanwa loan words: Eye, Moon, Death and, of course, Malorn. As suddenly as it began, it ends. Everyone returns to whatever they were doing.</p>
