I"Ë<p>Rarely seen outside of Cloudstone or the Deep Roads, Llewellyn is depicted as a Chained Giant without a face. He holds a chisel and hammer, but restrained as he is it seems unlikely he could make use of it. Rawson found a particular affinity for the depictions he found of this patient behemoth. His name can be found in the name of the largest river in Mondial: the river <em>Llewellynâ€™s Chain</em>, from which Chainâ€™s End also receives its name.</p>
