  <p>At the lowest level of Castle Marina is a large set of heavy iron double doors. Around . Wooden beams have been shoved into place between the grate to reinforce it from without. The guards expertly begin the process of removing the wooden beams one by one, as if they had practiced this several times before. Soldiers stand back against the wall with firearms and crossbows at the ready. The portcullis is drawn by a lever, accompanied by the sound of rushing water. When the portcullis is raised, the guard brings a heavy set of keys to the door. The key with the most rust is selected and inserted into the door. With the help of several other men, the great door is slowly swung outwards, revealing a wide stone staircase spiraling down into darkness.</p>
