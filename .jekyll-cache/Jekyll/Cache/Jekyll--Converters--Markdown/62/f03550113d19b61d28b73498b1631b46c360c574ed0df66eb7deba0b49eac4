I"Ô<p>Sitting at the top of the peninsula known as Marinalâ€™s Call, 
Redwater is ideally situated to observe any potential 
invasions by sea. Even enemy ships seeking to surprise Marina 
from Disparia would have to stick close to shore and would 
therefore need to take a long route around the Call. It is a 
well-fortified town of modest size. It takes its name from the 
last war with Disparia, where its walls marked the high-water mark of the Disparian advance.</p>
