  <p>From the Trades you are led through the Palisades, past the burnt body of a mage, now frozen solid in place. You are accompanied by first ten and eventually twenty royal guard, all of their faces covered by impassive silver masks. Their leather armor is clean and tightly-fitted. Some of them shake - whether from the cold or from fear of the large bovine monstrosity they have captured is unclear.</p>
