I"”<p>Little is known of the fae lands beyond Malornâ€™s veil. It is said the separation between the twilight realms of The Weald and the mundane lands of Mondial is thinnest within the Great Forest. Legend tells of a wicked and terrifing Raven King holding court over a gloaming court of faeries and beasts. The Auâ€™vanwa tell tales of a once beautiful and kind Horned Queen that ruled there, but shun the forests for fear of the whispers in the trees that drive travelers mad. If The Weald can hold such power over travelers from beyond the veil, what effects could traveling within the twilight realm itself have?</p>

    &lt;h3&gt;Au'vanwa&lt;/h3&gt;
        
    &lt;p&gt;The name for both the people and their home-in-exile. The Au'vanwa consider themselves not to be natives of Mondial, despite having lived here for generations. They are a group of elves, minotaurs and dragonborn, collectively "Lost and Away." Au'vanwa is hidden away in the desert near the Great Rift, far to the north-east. Their people shun the forests for fear of The Voice Within the Trees that calls them back to The Weald, where they believe the Raven King would seek to control them once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="container city"&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Balnying&lt;/h3&gt;
        
    &lt;p&gt;"Goblin Town" to those who can't bother to pronounce it. Its name means "Gift of Fire" and it is known as the largest settlement of the otherwise underground-dwelling people called Goblins. It is most-well known for being regularly burnt to the groun by the eccentric experiments of its populace, who are devout tinkers. Redwater residents tell the party that Knights have been dispatched from Chain's End to keep an eye on the continued development of dangerous weaponry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="container city"&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Chain's End&lt;/h3&gt;
        
    &lt;p&gt;The capitol city of the Kingdom of Marina, Chain's End sits over the mouth of the River Llewellyn's Chain ("The Chain"). It is the seat of nobility and the largest city in Mondial. Talpa Adamina informs the party that it is currently in lock-down due to an unknown plague.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="container city"&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;The Circle of Illusion&lt;/h3&gt;
        
    &lt;p&gt;Across the River Llewellyn's Chain, in the great forests at Mondial's center, is a loose confederacy of Mages. Spurned from the human kingdoms for their magical talents, the mages ban together for safety. Ora tells the party that it is a terrible place that brought more questions than answers. Of course, nothing in the Circle of Illusion is what it seems. Who knows to what ends they practice their charms?

<p>The Circle of Illusion was abandoned when the heroes arrived - by all save Kolat, who was barely sane. He was attempting to force the Mirror which contained Einan to reveal its secrets to him. By killing Kolat, the party killed the last remaining mage of the Circle of Illusion. It is now an abandoned village in the middle of the Great Forest, where masterless golems roam aimlessly, protecting an enclave that no longer exists. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;</p>

    &lt;h3&gt;Redwater&lt;/h3&gt;
        
    &lt;p&gt;Sitting at the top of the peninsula known as Marinal's Call, Redwater is ideally situated to observe any potential invasions by sea. Even enemy ships seeking to surprise Marina from Disparia would have to stick close to shore and would therefore need to take a long route around the Call. It is a well-fortified town of modest size. It takes its name from the last war with Disparia, where its walls marked the high-water mark of the Disparian advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="container city"&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;The School of Talen&lt;/h3&gt;
        
    &lt;p&gt;Known only to the Outlanders as a place of study, it is a Lundisian operation by the sea far to the west. The Scholars seek to uncover the truth about the Artifacts and their use. It is the only Lundisian-owned land outside the Great Forest, sitting on a piece of Marina leased to the Lundisians. Now the Lundisians are no more and the future of Talen remains uncertain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="container city"&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Malachi's Watch&lt;/h3&gt;
        
    &lt;p&gt;The Capitol of Disparia, known as The City of Locked Doors. Its residents are staunchly opposed to allowing outsiders within its walls, and fiercely anti-magic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="container city"&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;White Tower&lt;/h3&gt;
        
    &lt;p&gt;The mysterious Capitol of Lundis, deep in the illusory forest at the center of Mondial. Seat of the Church of Lundis, at the head of which sits their King. Canonically founded by Malorn, whose Church is the state religion of Lundis.

<p>White Tower was razed to the ground by a joint Disparian-Cloudstone invasion. The Disparian soldiers used dragon fire to bring down its great cathedral and central tower that gave the city its name. The party knows that Einan the Black destroyed the dragons, but it was too late for Lundis: the queen is dead, the people of the forest scattered. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;</p>
