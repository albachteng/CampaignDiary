  <p>The sound of the heavy door slamming behind you reverberates against stone walls. From beyond, you can hear the sounds of the shrieking, malformed flies and glowing centipedes as the fire overtakes the hanging gardens. The smell of smoke rises faintly from the edges of the door. At first, you feel hammering , but it ends quickly as the hanging bridges crumble and crash to the cavern floor.</p>
