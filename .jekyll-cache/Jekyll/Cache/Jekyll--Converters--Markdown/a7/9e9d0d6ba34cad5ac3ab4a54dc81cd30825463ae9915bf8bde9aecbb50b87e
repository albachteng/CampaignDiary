I"‘<p>Seemingly a large hunk of shiny metal with finger holes. It is considered silvered and deals 2d6 bludgeoning damage, and can be wielded in either hand. The weapon crits on 19 or 20 (18, 19 or 20 if you already have an ability that grants criticals on a 19) and stuns the enemy until the end of its next turn when it does. Requires strength of at least 15 to wield. Does not require attunement.</p>
