  <p>The stone castle rises straight out from the water. A long narrow land bridge connects it to the shore at low tide, but right now it is flooded. Its most peculiar feature is the central telescope peeking out from the battlements above the highest tower. Davenport gives the command to drop anchor at some distance due to choppy waters and the threat of rocks near the surface. First Mate Wheatley offers to row you and Gerth to the fortress.</p>

<p>After discovering more of the strange mask-runes on the ship, the party weighs anchor at the Circle of Enchantment. They discover it is heavily guarded, the mages that live there are more prisoners than students. Gerth is left with the enchanter Elizabeth, who believes she can restore him, or at least that she is his best bet.</p>

<p>Back on the ship, Lem tinkers with his new armor. Isho teaches Ulrach to divine the future from his ancestral sands - which he keeps with him at all times. The party finds even more of the strange mask-runes on the ship, apparently burnt into the wood by some device. The second mate, Verdie, recounts a time when she turned a mage into the Circle for a nice reward.</p>

<p>The ship goes further out to sea, where few normally travel, out of sight of the shore. Captain Davenport says that few that dare do so here ever return.</p>

<p>Isho catches the goblin engineer, Hanford, peeking up on deck in the dead of night. Isho follows him below, finds him crouched behind a barrel doing… something. The goblin talks quickly, offers Isho a sleeping draught so that he can rest, which Isho takes but does not drink. After consulting with Lem, they discover it is poison. Behind the crate is another mask-rune.</p>

<p>Isho convinces the captain the Hanford must be brought in for questioning. Davenport agrees - and asks that the party bring him, by force if necessary. There is a desperate struggle as Hanford attempts to trick Hubert and escape, but Hanford is captured and brought before the captain.</p>

<p>When questioned, the goblin only says that he has saved everyone and that “you don’t know your own faces. But you will soon. Lucius awakens.”</p>

<p>Above, they can hear a topman crying out - a ship has been sighted. A mastless, drifting ship in the open waters. As the party approaches, the name of the ship, printed along its side, faded as it is, appears clearly.</p>
