You can just barely make out the sound of running water somewhere far beyond it - lost in those trees is the fabled river East Chain. And still further beyond that, the sorcerous Circle of Illusion, your destination. The Auâ€™vanwa shun the Forest. The Marinese fear it. And the Lundisians thrive on its aura of mystery.</p>
