        The heat of the sun, coupled with the 
        stillness of the air, weighs on you 
        oppressively. The sparse cries of seagulls 
        punctuate the steady, lazy lapping of waves 
        against the ship on which you are passengers. 
        The salt air mingles with the sweat of sailors. 
        You were hired to protect The Last Word and its 
        cargo by a group of Filian Wizards. It is day ten.
