- name: Beldryn Bronzeheart

  desc: > 
    Beldryn changed his last name to Bronzeheart after joining the Bronze Bank of Filia to hide his shame: he was ousted from the Iron Halls for a foolhardy ploy in the War of the Golden Mountains. Seeking to force a quick end to the war, he gambled with the lives of an entire battalion under his command throwing them in full force against the advancing enemy, but was outsmarted by the Goblins of the nearby Iron Hills. Almost none survived the battle, although the dwarves did eventually win the war. His true name is Beldryn Runeguard, making him the heir to a long line of decorated Kingsguard.

  desc: > 
    Lem to his companions, this sneaky goblin hails from the Iron Hills. He exhibits an insatiable curiosity and fondness for tinkering with potions and equipment - the more explosive, the better. Sly and perceptive, he gets the party out of trouble almost as quick as he can get them into trouble. The rogue has proven himself particularly convincing and charming when it comes to sniffing out work for the party, and talking his way out of difficult situations, often with an assumed dialect.

  desc: > 
    Rawson Titanwound's background, before joining the mercenaries of the Bronze Vault of Filia, was as a hunter of beasts. He took a particular speciality in lycanthropy, and therefore styles himself as a Werewolf Hunter. His skills with beasts have already helped the party out of dire situations, as it turns out there are beasts aplenty in Mondial. Generally seeing himself as the voice of reason in the party, his contributions have more often than not gently nudged the party down a safer path.

- name: Isho-Genni Hassada
  link: https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/27859882/kKKN7J
  desc: > 
    Isho hails from the sands beyond the Golden Hills, making him a foreigner among foreigners in the party. A member of a nomadic tribe, he was raised as a Sun Warrior, like his father before him and his grandmother before that. He carries with him a small amount of desert sands, which serves as an oracle for ritual divination, and wields the distinctive yari swordspear of his people. Isho is a stalwart warrior, often rushing to the front of the group to serve as the party's bulwark. He speaks Common slowly and carefully, unfamiliar as he is with the language, and he often finds the lifestyle of city dwellers confusing, but his strong moral character makes him the heart and conscience of the party.

- name: Ulrach Thyrmyr

    The party knew little of his kind before arriving in Mondial, but Ulrach of the Au'vanwa quickly demonstrated that his kind are trustworthy, serious and capable warriors. His tribe instilled in him a powerful distrust of arcane artifacts and The Art, but with Chain's End closed and his tribe desperate for resources, he agrees to join the adventurers to investigate the practices of Lundis and The Circle of Illusion within the forests he was taught to avoid for the good of his tribe.

- name: Hubert
  link: /resources/sheets/Hubert.pdf
  desc: > 
    When the party first found him, he was part of a band of mercenaries killing adventurers and stealing any magical items they could find. But Hubert quickly made a deal with them in exchange for his life and he has more than kept his word. Raised in Lundis as an assassin for the Church, his first loyalty is to his god Malorn. With the fall of Lundis to Disparian invasion, Hubert has stood by his new companions longer than he originally anticipated. And with his previously destroyed legs now miraculously healed, he seems bent on re-establishing the Church of Malorn and some other grim task seemingly revealed to him in prayer: to kill Einan the Black, the Mage-Prince of Disparia.
