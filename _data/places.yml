- name: Marina
  desc: >
    Canonically founded by the Goddess of Storm and Sea Marinal, 
    the people of Marina are a sea-faring sort, although they readily
    admit that they do not venture far from the sight of shore - those who
    do are rarely seen again. Marina's dominance of the waters has led to 
    conflict with Disparia in the past. Regardless, they are an overwhelmingly
    pastoral kingdom, with broad swathes of land dedicated to agriculture. Marina
    was the first and currently only kingdom to make trade with the Goblins for
    their smokepowder weapons.

    Smallest of the human Kingdoms, the city is protected primarily by its location: deep 
    in the enchanted and beast-filled forests at the center of Mondial, where few dare to 
    travel. Its proximity to The Circle of Illusion has led to the general belief that they 
    are the most sympathetic to the practice of magic. Their major export is a variety of 
    healing potion with a bioluminescent glow. The party learns from Talpa that their Church
    claims to have developed a means of preventing the frenzy that comes with the use of Artifacts.

- name: Disparia
  desc: >
    Friends to none, the Disparians are known to be militant and fiercely protective. Their
    proximity to the desert leads to regular conflict with the Au'vanwa nomads that dwell there. 
    Disparia invaded Marina in generations past, but Marina held the line, ultimately ceding 
    the Bay of Fire to the Disparian King.
