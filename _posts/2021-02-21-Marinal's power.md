>Rain and seawater mix in the storm, making every surface of the ship slick. The intermittent lightning offers brief splashes of daylight. The central mast, just struck, hangs suspended at an unnatural angle momentarily before crashing heavily into the water, bringing with it several topmen. Fearful shouts go up all around you as sailors and officers rush to their stations, grabbing swords, crossbows and harpoons, trying to make order from the chaos. Even the most seasoned among them need to latch onto ropes, railings, anything bolted down to prevent tumbling into the crashing waves as the ship reels from one side to the other. At moments, the ship sinks into the valleys between crests and at those times the world becomes almost silent. The creature itself moves without sound, a tentacle slides out from the water and begins groping blindly along the deck, sweeping this way and that, knocking flat the sailors too slow to jump aside. And through it all, the four winds wail against the suddenly miniscule ship, The Gin Mule.

The corpses on the ship animate and attack. At first, the battle is easy, but then the real horror begins. The corpses break apart, hands scuttling like spiders, spines contorting, skulls chattering as they form into a collective - a flesh-and-bone monstrosity that operates like a swarm of skittering insects, breaking apart and coming back together at will to assault the party. Tzitzik, or Hanford, dies to this monstrosity immediately, but the rest of the party manage to make it out alive. 

Having cleared the ship (in part thanks to Isho and Ulrach's foresight in dumping the bodies into the water before they can reform) the party has a substantial prize - the remaining cargo of *The Last Word* is potentially valuable in their efforts to outfit and support the Au'vanwa. Molotovs, Blue Elixir, Numbing Mist - all valuable concoctions and enough to outfit a small warband. 

The victory is short-lived. The winds have ceased. The ship cannot move without the motor - and its inventor just died. Lem gets set to the exhausting work of figuring out the contraption's workings but is confounded by what appears to be a missing medium at the engine's heart. 

Time passes. Tensions rise. The wind picks up again, but celebrations are premature - in minutes, the captain orders the sails raised for fear of capsizing. Waves crash against the ship's sides. Water elementals are seen forming and dissipating around the ship. And black clouds swell overhead, releasing heavy rains and lightning. The long-awaited wind has turned into a storm. 

It is a familiar experience for many in the party. Whether it is to finish the job, by mere chance or fate, the kraken has returned to finish the job it started all those months ago on *The Last Word* - and now sets its sights on *The Gin Mule*. 

Just as the kraken is attacking, Hubert rushes into Hanford's quarters and desperately searches through his notes - the machine is mentioned briefly, along with reference to "Marinal's Power" as a necessary element. In a stroke of insight, Hubert realizes the engine needs a water elemental to make the machine function. 

It is no easy thing to capture a water elemental. It is somewhat more difficult when a kraken is attacking. Nevertheless, Isho and Hubert brave the waves and manage to bag one in a leather satchel, rushing it to Lem to complete the engine. But first, they have to save the ship and fight off the kraken. 

Towards the fight's end, the bouncing ball of blue-green lightning pops up on the main deck, and Rogga, wielding a sword that glows with eerie moonlight, slashes at the tentacles, supernaturally quick, severing one and then several while the party make their escape with the help of the newly powered engine.

Rogga calls to the party: "I will not see you again, for a long time. You watch: my awakening." Without another word, he dives into the ocean, chasing after the fleeing kraken.
