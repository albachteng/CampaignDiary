Entering into the forest has the effect of silencing the world. Even the wind goes quiet. All is still. You sense, rather than see, the trees pressing in against you, closing ranks. The dense, murky smells of moss and earth overwhelm your senses. In the stillness, a single, repetitive sound emerges: your own heartbeat. These woods fill you with dread and foreboding. 

Less than an hour in, you stumble upon the first corpse, its back against a tree, lying with arms spread open, its vacant eye sockets lifted skyward. It is little more than a skeleton now.

The Forest plays its tricks. The party wanders for days. They get lost, hear voices and the faint ringing of bells and at one point wake up to find that all of the luggage has been carefully unpacked and placed around their camp in a spiral pattern, organized by size and color. The party loses time - an entire day passes without making any progress as they become entranced by a caterpillar crawling along a branch. At night, unblinking eyes watch them from just beyond the fire's dim light. 

The party has their first encounter with a golem in a collapsed dungeon entrance - an enormous monstrosity of clay. After failing to damage it, the party flees further into the woods. They hear wolves crying. They make the mistake of harming a tree and find themselves battling an endless army of living plants, and must flee again. They find doll replicas of themselves sitting on the forest floor. 

Finally, they meet a friendly face - a ruddy, wild, unkempt face. Rogga the dwarf, covered in soot and ravenously digging his crooked teeth into a squirrel he has killed, invites them to share his fire. 

He speaks haltingly, as one unaccustomed to speech, and has a habit of smiling and nodding while he says "no." He talks abstractly of people who are not there: "Raven Man" and "Brother Mountain" and "Horny Queen". When asked for guidance, he stands, stomps his foot once, and a raised mound of earth snakes along the earth and into the distance, dodging through trees to create a rudimentary path. He warns them not to step away from it. 

Unfortunately, the party does not heed his warning. Hubert and Ulrach are quickly lost in the fogs and dense underbrush when a gibbering mouther - a fleshy abomination of eyes and mouths wrapped around sludge - attacks. 

Each character has an encounter with an illusion from their past. 

- Rawson watches his friend Beldryn die again and again, begging Rawson not to abandon him. 
- Lem sees his father in his workshop burning to cinders along with all his workers.
- Isho comes face-to-face with the accusing eyes of his village's elder. 
- Hubert hears the singing of his only friend, tortured to madness by the Church he serves. 
- And Ulrach sees Talpa, accusing him of violent horrors. 

It is Ulrach who manages to break through the illusion to see that The Gentleman is behind it all. 

<blockquote>
The figure before you sprouts horns. Talpa’s skin grows scaly and shimmers golden against the light of the fire. Where once was Talpa now sits The Gentleman. “What I want would be so exquisitely agreeable to your kind, if you would only see His Beauty. Our mother was the Horned Queen that rutted with Beasts. Our father is the Black-winged Sky. Let us blot out the light of this hateful moon forever, my friend. There is no need for your fantasy of silver dragons. The Raven King is Chief of Chiefs. Help me blot out the light. Help me take back my mirror.”
</blockquote>

Ulrach refuses. The Gentleman snaps his fingers. "So be it." A column of darkness descends on the forest, and Ulrach is plunged into pitch black night.
