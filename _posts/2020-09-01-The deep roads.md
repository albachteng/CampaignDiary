>You awake in near-darkness. Smoldering ashes cast long, thin, faint shadows away from camp. Along the walls, swirling patterned grooves cut into the stone form a channel for a creeping luminous moss. The effect is like a faintly yellow glowing calligraphy coating the walls and ceilings of the wide hallway. Rogga described this place as a road. It is large and wide enough to accommodate a grown dragon. Torchlight barely reaches from one end to the other. Camped, as you are, at the crossroads, the enormity of the Deep Roads becomes apparent. 

>And so: North to Malachi’s Watch, South to Chain’s End, or West to White Tower. 

In the depths below the collapsed grotto, the party again encounters Rogga, who welcomes them to the Deep Roads. 

Hubert sets the tone by standing by the West road. The others agree: Lundis is their destination. In the dark and maze-like depths, they discover the strange remnants of a long-buried civilization: statues to an unfamiliar god, a robed figure masked by a serenely smiling sun. 

>You hear them long before you see them: singing, softly, wordlessly, their chant echoing off the stone walls. They are apparently making no effort to hide their music, and you can tell there are at least a dozen of them, a mix of male, female and indeterminate voices, young and old. The mood is rapturous and solemn. 

>Dark-robed figures, obscuring their faces with heavy cloaks against the chill and damp of the Deep Roads stand in a semi-circle facing a wall. They have lit candles around a section of wall that has been roughly cut into to create a sea of orbs - moons, eyes - all connected by the grooves and ridges previously designed. As a result of this effacement, the luminous moss has crown into the circular patterns. But this fungus has been changed somehow, from the orange-yellow glow everywhere else into a cool blue-green. Further down along the path, the road narrows into a series of arched doorways.
