>At the lowest level of Castle Marina is a large set of heavy iron double doors. Over the door hangs an iron portcullis. Wooden beams have been shoved into place between the grate to reinforce it from without. The guards expertly begin the process of removing the wooden beams one by one, as if they had practiced this several times before. Soldiers stand back against the wall with firearms and crossbows at the ready. The portcullis is drawn by a lever, accompanied by the sound of rushing water. When the portcullis is raised, the guard brings a heavy set of keys to the door. The key with the most rust is selected and inserted into the door. With the help of several others, the great door is slowly swung outwards, revealing a wide stone staircase spiraling down into darkness. 

The citizens who succumbed to infection during the city's lockdown were herded into the dungeons - an act of great shame to the leadership of Marina, but one that they deemed absolutely necessary. Those infected became violent and beastly, killing many before the soldiers could subdue them. 

The Pygmy that Lem has hired shows up unexpectedly, claiming to be there to make certain that her wishes are carried out. The soldiers do not seem to notice her presence. 

The party descends into the depths, below the lowest levels of the city, below the water level of the river and the sea. In the dungeon below, a handful of survivors of the plague scratch out a living with occasional aid left at the bottom of the stairs by the soldiers. A survivor named Saul points them in the direction of the maze's heart, where Eileen the Crow wanders off sometimes. Apparently she chases after the infected and sets traps to make sure they don't come back. 

Eileen's traps are devious. They pass through a gauntlet of flamethrowers (taking one off its tripod for future use) and crumbling platforms over churning waters. The entire dungeon seems to operate off the tides - water flows in through grated waterfalls. There are hanging cages where prisoners who were once humanoid have either escaped or were freed, but they find one still occupied by a man who, horrifically, transforms into a hulking, slimy-skinned monstrosity with a face like a barnacle-covered shark. 

While fighting off infected monstrosities, their pygmy companion turns on them and reveals herself to be Alva - the same Pygmy that had accompanied the party into White Tower. She blasts Rawson, Isho and Lem with ice and fire, blaming Lem for the death of her companion in the White Tower dungeons. 

Alva dies. The infected die. The party moves on. 

They find Eileen, called The Crow for her black-feathered garb. She is a goblin with a mechanical arm. In the dungeons, she has taken upon herself the task of setting traps and segregating the turned infected from those still healthy enough to survive above. She is puzzling over a statue puzzle in a side-room when the party enters. 

The sign above the door to this room reads, in familiar, Common script: "Face your fears." The statues can be rotated freely, and on top of each of them is a different depiction of the gods of Mondial: skeletal Malorn, severe Malachi with his downward pointing sword, wind-tossed Marinal, a robed figure whose mask is a serenly smiling sun, a chained giant, an imp who appears to be laughing and crying at once and a large raven, its wings spread. 

Their first attempt - turning all the statues to face the Raven in the center of the room, sees Ulrach driven mad by frenzy. The party works together to restrain him and feed him Communion. Their second attempt - each facing a different statue of their choice, has some interesting consequences, including a boon for Rawson, who selects the chained giant. 

They pass by murals depicting Malorn watching impassively as dozens of humanoid figures appear to burn. Myca identifies the central node. The party needs to clear the room of enormous, shark-like humanoids with barnacles growing along their skin. One drops from the ceiling and surprises them. 

>Its skin is scaly and wet. Its giant back bent and crumpled under the weight of an enormous head. The sorry creature has the jaws of a grinning shark, its maw a set of jagged razor blades, rows upon rows of glittering glass daggers leading back down its dark gullet. Its bony knuckles drag on the floor, hunched over as it is. You can tell that this one has been here a while by the barnacles that have grown all over its back and chest. It reeks of rotting fish and seascum. With an inhuman gurgling roar it lunges at you, ferocious in its speed. 

Curiously, during the fight, Ulrach exhibits another newfound power - firebreathing. The party does not question it, growing cautiously accustomed to his emerging abilities. 

At the back of the dungeon, where they leave Myca, they find a beautiful doorway painted right into the wall. It depicts a castle on the precipice of a cliff over the sea. Lem investigates with his magic but learns only that it is a portal. Eileen mentions that the pygmies that were trapped down here always headed right for this area and were never seen again.
