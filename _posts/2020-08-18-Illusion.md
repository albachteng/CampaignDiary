At the top of an invisible staircase, after a fight with a failed golem, through illusory chambers filled with fire and choked of all air and light, they find a runic symbol that inverts gravity throughout the buildings and allows them to enter the second tower upside down, climbing it, bizarrely, into the depths of the earth...
