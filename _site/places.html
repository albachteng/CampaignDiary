        <p><p>The Deep Roads have been systematically sealed throughout the human kingdoms. Only the Dwarves of Cloudstone dare make their home among the dark depths. What little the party has seen of The Deep Roads implies a once vast and mighty kingdom and the worship of strange gods - a chained giant, a laughing imp and a serenely smiling sun. The party knows the Drow hide underground, and the Goblins recently emerged from The Deep Roads to make a new home for themselves on the surface in Marina.</p>

        <p><p>Friends to none, the Disparians are known to be militant and fiercely protective. Their proximity to the desert leads to regular conflict with the Au’vanwa nomads that dwell there. Disparia invaded Marina in generations past, but Marina held the line, ultimately ceding the Bay of Fire to the Disparian King.<br />Now Disparia is making war again. It was Disparia, with the apparent help or at least acquiescence of Cloudstone, that obliterated White Tower, and with it the sovereign nation of Lundis. They did so with a terrible power: the party watched dragon riders descend upon the unsuspecting city.</p>

        <p><p>Smallest of the human Kingdoms, the city is protected primarily by its location: deep in the enchanted and beast-filled forests at the center of Mondial, where few dare to travel. Its proximity to The Circle of Illusion has led to the general belief that they are the most sympathetic to the practice of magic. Their major export is a variety of healing potion with a bioluminescent glow. The party learns from Talpa that their Church claims to have developed a means of preventing the frenzy that comes with the use of Artifacts.<br /><br />With the destruction of White Tower, Lundis now exists only in the hearts of its scattered people. The fate of those who remained is unknown. The Queen is dead and the Church obliterated.</p>

        <p><p>Canonically founded by the Goddess of Storm and Sea Marinal, 
the people of Marina are a sea-faring sort, although they readily
admit that they do not venture far from the sight of shore - those who
do are rarely seen again. Marina’s dominance of the waters has led to 
conflict with Disparia in the past. Regardless, they are an overwhelmingly
pastoral kingdom, with broad swathes of land dedicated to agriculture. Marina
was the first and currently only kingdom to make trade with the Goblins for
their smokepowder weapons.<br /><br />The party has been hired several times by the Marinese nobility and have gained quite a reputation among them. Duke Goeffrey in particular places great faith in the adventurers.</p>

        <p><p>Little is known of the fae lands beyond Malorn’s veil. It is said the separation between the twilight realms of The Weald and the mundane lands of Mondial is thinnest within the Great Forest. Legend tells of a wicked and terrifing Raven King holding court over a gloaming court of faeries and beasts. The Au’vanwa tell tales of a once beautiful and kind Horned Queen that ruled there, but shun the forests for fear of the whispers in the trees that drive travelers mad. If The Weald can hold such power over travelers from beyond the veil, what effects could traveling within the twilight realm itself have?</p>
