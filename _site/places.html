        <p><p>The Deep Roads have been systematically sealed throughout the human kingdoms. Only the Dwarves of Cloudstone dare make their home among the dark depths. What little the party has seen of The Deep Roads implies a once vast and mighty kingdom and the worship of strange gods - a chained giant, a laughing imp and a serenely smiling sun. The party knows the Drow hide underground, and the Goblins recently emerged from The Deep Roads to make a new home for themselves on the surface in Marina.</p>

Here the adventurers had their first encounter with the drow, dark-robed humanoids. The drow they fought were infected with a frenzied madness that transformed them into hideous beasts. Ultimately, more - uninfected - drow joined the fray and killed their frenzied brethren before snapping a <em>staff of power</em> to cause the cathedral to collapse.</p>

        <p><p>Friends to none, the Disparians are known to be militant and fiercely protective. Their proximity to the desert leads to regular conflict with the Au’vanwa nomads that dwell there. Disparia invaded Marina in generations past, but Marina held the line, ultimately ceding the Bay of Fire to the Disparian King.<br />Now Disparia is making war again. It was Disparia, with the apparent help or at least acquiescence of Cloudstone, that obliterated White Tower, and with it the sovereign nation of Lundis. They did so with a terrible power: the party watched dragon riders descend upon the unsuspecting city.</p>

They are a group of elves, minotaurs and dragonborn, collectively “Lost and Away.” Au’vanwa is hidden away in the desert near the Great Rift, far to the north-east. Their people shun the forests for fear of The Voice Within the Trees that calls them back to The Weald, where they believe the Raven King would seek to control them once more.</p>

Their major export is a variety of healing potion with a bioluminescent glow. The party learns from Talpa that their Church claims to have developed a means of preventing the frenzy that comes with the use of Artifacts.<br /><br />With the destruction of White Tower, Lundis now exists only in the hearts of its scattered people. The fate of those who remained is unknown. The Queen is dead and the Church obliterated.</p>

Of course, nothing in the Circle of Illusion is what it seems. Who knows to what ends they practice their charms? <br /><br />The Circle of Illusion was abandoned when the heroes arrived - by all save Kolat, who was barely sane. He was attempting to force the Mirror which contained Einan to reveal its secrets to him. By killing Kolat, the party killed the last remaining mage of the Circle of Illusion. It is now an abandoned village in the middle of the Great Forest, where masterless golems roam aimlessly, protecting an enclave that no longer exists.</p>

conflict with Disparia in the past. Regardless, they are an overwhelmingly
pastoral kingdom, with broad swathes of land dedicated to agriculture. Marina
was the first and currently only kingdom to make trade with the Goblins for
their smokepowder weapons.<br /><br />The party has been hired several times by the Marinese nobility and have gained quite a reputation among them. Duke Goeffrey in particular places great faith in the adventurers.</p>

                    <p><p>Sitting at the top of the peninsula known as Marinal’s Call, Redwater is ideally situated to observe any potential invasions by sea. Even enemy ships seeking to surprise Marina from Disparia would have to stick close to shore and would therefore need to take a long route around the Call. It is a well-fortified town of modest size. It takes its name from the last war with Disparia, where its walls marked the high-water mark of the Disparian advance.</p>

Atop its peak lies Balnying. The party ventured through a secret entrance at its base into The Deep Roads where they fought a flaming mechanical abomination of the Goblins that rested among the magma. With its defeat, Lem and Isho gained a valuable prize, a fire elemental gem.</p>

        <p><p>Little is known of the fae lands beyond Malorn’s veil. It is said the separation between the twilight realms of The Weald and the mundane lands of Mondial is thinnest within the Great Forest. Legend tells of a wicked and terrifing Raven King holding court over a gloaming court of faeries and beasts. The Au’vanwa tell tales of a once beautiful and kind Horned Queen that ruled there, but shun the forests for fear of the whispers in the trees that drive travelers mad. If The Weald can hold such power over travelers from beyond the veil, what effects could traveling within the twilight realm itself have?</p>
