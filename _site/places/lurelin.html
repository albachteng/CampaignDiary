<p>The village of Lurelin was renamed to Malik after Disparia took control of the Bay of Fire a century ago. It is known as one of the most isolated settlements in all of Mondial, sitting at the far eastern edge of The Rifts. The small town primarily serves as a fort and observation point for Disparian soldiers. It has a small, quiet community of Marinese loyalists.</p>
