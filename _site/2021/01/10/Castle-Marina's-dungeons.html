          <h1>Castle marina's dungeons</h1>
    <h2>10 Jan 2021</h2>
    <blockquote>
  <p>At the lowest level of Castle Marina is a large set of heavy iron double doors. Over the door hangs an iron portcullis. Wooden beams have been shoved into place between the grate to reinforce it from without. The guards expertly begin the process of removing the wooden beams one by one, as if they had practiced this several times before. Soldiers stand back against the wall with firearms and crossbows at the ready. The portcullis is drawn by a lever, accompanied by the sound of rushing water. When the portcullis is raised, the guard brings a heavy set of keys to the door. The key with the most rust is selected and inserted into the door. With the help of several others, the great door is slowly swung outwards, revealing a wide stone staircase spiraling down into darkness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The citizens who succumbed to infection during the city’s lockdown were herded into the dungeons - an act of great shame to the leadership of Marina, but one that they deemed absolutely necessary. Those infected became violent and beastly, killing many before the guards could subdue them. Therefore even the appearance of infection led to banishment to the dungeons below the city’s lowest levels, underneath the river itself.</p>
