        <div><p>
            <p>You’ve seen the drow wear these robes. When attuned and wearing it, this item grants resistance to force, cold and psychic damage types.</p>

        <div><p>
            <p>Deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage and is otherwise functionally a regular mace, except where noted below. <br /><br /> Trick: The mace head is a tarnished bronze cup. Use an action to transform, which reveals it to be a bell. It gains the long-reach property (15ft). Its damage becomes psychic and can be applied to all enemies in range. Gains the Arcane property, allowing you to add your Intelligence Modifier to damage and attack rolls.</p>

        <div><p>
            <p>Boom Hammer: 1d8 bludgeoning, versatile 1d10. 
<br /><br />Trick: Bonus action before attack to “light it”, priming the next attack with an explosive charge to drive it into the foe. The next attack deals an additional 1d6 fire damage and then resets.</p>

        <div><p>
            <p>Deals 1d8 slashing, finesse
<br /><br />Trick: Bonus action transforms this saber into a bladed whip, gaining the long-reach property (a 15ft range). 
<br /><br />It gains the Arcane property when transformed, allowing you to add your intelligence modifier to attack and damage rolls. 
<br /><br />In the transformed state, you cannot attack enemies within 5ft of you, including attacks of opportunity. You can, however, make attacks of opportunity against opponents who exit your 15ft range.</p>

            <p>Drinking this elixir recovers 2d4 to your frenzy meter. 
<br /><br />Ulrach and Hubert discovered the secret to its creation while trapped beneath the White Tower cathedral - it is distilled from humanoid brain and spinal fluid. Ulrach may very well have contributed to a batch while in captivity.</p>

                <p>
                    You may use one consummable item per round as a free action. Subsequent uses within a round consume a full Action.

        <div><p>
            <p>Coating a non-magical weapon in this oil (which requires one action) adds 1d8 force, cold or psychic damage (your choice) to the weapon’s attacks for 3 rounds. The weapon gains the Arcane property for the duration, allowing you to add your Intelligence modifier to the damage and attack roll.<br /><br />You cannot use this consummable on a weapon that already has a bonus to attack or damage.</p>

        <h2 class="item">Cursed Rakuyo<br><span class="item-type">weapon</span></h2>
        <div><p>
            <p>Requires attunement. This twinsword has +2 to attack and damage rolls. <br /><br />As a bonus action, you can separate it into a rapier and dagger, which also are +2 weapons that deal 1d6 each but are otherwise identical to a rapier and dagger (finesse, light, thrown, etc). Attacks are considered magical. It has the following additional properties: <br /><br /> * <em>First Blood</em>: Only after you have lost 50% of your total HP, as an action, you can expend 2 hit die and cut yourself to impale the weapons with your own blood (this deals no damage to you, and the wounds you create in this manner heal instantaneously). Your attacks gain the reach property (+5 feet) and deal an additional 1d10 necrotic damage. When you take this action, you must roll 1d4 and add the number to your frenzy.<br /><br />* <em>Exsanguinate</em>: After having taken the First Blood action, you may take an action to expunge the blood from the blades, losing the effects of first blood. Doing so creates a 20ft explosion of fire centered on yourself. This has the effect of casting fireball at level 3 centered on yourself. The DC for the dexterity save is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your charisma modifier. All creatures that fail the save take 8d6 fire damage and half as much on a successful save. You have advantage on the saving throw and instead take no damage on a save and half damage on a failure. Regardless, you must roll 1d4 and add the number to your frenzy.</p>

        <div><p>
            <p>A purplish fluorescent liquid. This fills your frenzy meter but allows you to retain control for up to 10 minutes, at the end of which time, the condition ends and your frenzy is reduced by 1 (leaving you 1 step away from true beasthood). 
<br /><br />
You can also voluntarily end the effect as an action. You are partially transformed into a horrifying beast, lycanthropic in form, granting you the following: 
<br /><br /></p>
<ul>
  <li>Advantage on all Intimidation checks</li>
  <li>Disadvantage on Wisdom, Intelligence and Charisma saving throws</li>
  <li>One extra damage die for any attack you make - this applies only to the regular physical portion of any attacks made</li>
  <li>Vulnerability to silvered weapons and magic attacks</li>
  <li>Resistance to all other forms of damage</li>
  <li>You are one size larger as if affected by the enlarge/reduce spell</li>
  <li>You gain 30ft of movement</li>
  <li>If your frenzy increases by any amount while you are transformed, you must make a Wisdom save against losing control of your character, or else be driven mad by beasthood (ceding control of your character to the DM)</li>
</ul>

        <div><p>
            <p>This club deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage and has the heavy property.<br /><br />With a bonus action, the club can be opened along a seam down its center, revealing it to house a lute. It gains the long-range and Arcane properties, allowing you to add your intelligence modifier to your attack and damage rolls. In its transformed state it deals 1d10 thunder damage.</p>

        <div><p>
            <p>Requires attunement. This strange glass-like shield, when equipped, lowers your AC by 2, but when taking magical damage you are considered to be in 3/4 cover (+5 to AC and +5 to DEX saving throws against magical effects). Requires an action to don or doff the shield during combat.</p>

        <div><p>
            <p>Seemingly a large hunk of shiny metal with finger holes. It is considered silvered and deals 2d6 bludgeoning damage, and can be wielded in either hand. The weapon crits on 19 or 20 (18, 19 or 20 if you already have an ability that grants criticals on a 19) and stuns the enemy until the end of its next turn when it does. Requires strength of at least 15 to wield. Does not require attunement.</p>

            <p>Lem received this item from the wizard Kolat. It is a six-inch square puzzle box, capable of being manipulated into a number of bizarre geometrical configurations. After some effort, he discovered one possible solution, which allowed the bearer to use it as an arcane focus and cast Chill Touch as a cantrip, manifesting ghostly tentacles instead of hands.<br /><br />It may have other secrets to reveal, but so far he has been unsuccessful in solving the other configurations.</p>

        <h2 class="item">The Mirror of Einan<br><span class="item-type">artifact</span></h2>
        <div><p>
            <p>Circled round with ancient runes and grasped on either side by stone hands, the Mirror was found in the possession of the mage Kolat in the luminous grotto below the Circle of Illusion. Kolat could not discover the Mirror’s secrets.<br /><br />Rogga told Ulrach it would reveal its secrets if looked at “where you cannot see.” Ultimately, when Ulrach watched the mirror under fading firelight, he was able to see what was on the other side: A dark-haired man in a lavish office, wearing black gloves. <br /><br />The Mirror of Einan was a prison to its namesake for nearly one hundred years. Ulrach and Lem were able to use it to communicate with him. At first, neither party could hear the other, but Einan guided Lem through a blood ritual to allow them to speak - a ritual that Ulrach pointedly refused. <br /><br />Einan desired freedom, but was willing to demonstrate to Lem that he could be trusted, granting him powerful advantages against Pontiff Sulyvahn. <br /><br />The Mirror was destroyed and its prisoner released when Lem opened his wrists on its surface and granted Einan permission to escape. In recompense, Einan killed three adult dragons for the party with a nod of his head and promptly disappeared.</p>

        <div><p>
            <p>Beldryn briefly wielded this legendary artifact on <em>The Last Word</em> against a kraken. The kraken hid the face of a serenly smiling woman behind its hideous beak, and embraced both the sword and its bearer. All three were lost beneath the waves, along with the ship and most of its crew. <br /><br />The Moon carries special significance to the inhabitants of Mondial, and to its religions. Worshippers of all the major gods of the pantheon have different theories as to what the Moon represents. In Lundis, it is called Malorn’s Eye, watching over his worshippers. In Marina, it is believed to be Marinal’s child, sacrificed to protect her people from endless seas. The Au’vanwa prophecy that the Moon is an egg, which will one day hatch into a great silver dragon to defeat the enemies of Mondial. 
<br /><br />It must have been an impressive sword to receive such a title.</p>

When you shoot a creature, you can also hit additional creatures in a line behind the creature you were aiming for. You must make a new attack roll, and the damage die decreases by one for each additional creature beyond the first shot in this manner. <br /><br />This property allows you to hit a creature behind the one you were aiming for, even if you missed that attack. In other words, you continue rolling attack rolls on enemies in a straight line until the damage die have been reduced to 0 or you have run out of targets. <br /><br />The reload property means you can fire (in this case) twice before you must reload. If you are proficient, you can reload with a bonus action (which requires one free hand). If you are not proficient, you must use your action. This property can be improved.</p>

You can teleport 10ft as a free action, including as a reaction (once per round) in response to an attack, nullifying the attack.

        <div><p>
            <p>Using this sickly green dagger requires that you pierce the flesh of an enemy to gain their temporary subservience. Doing so destroys the blade. The enemy makes a DC12 wisdom save to avoid the effects, and otherwise is an ally for 3 rounds. <br /><br />Afterwards, the creature regains control over itself but may not remember what has happened after being stabbed.</p>

            <p>This small, ancient bell acts as an arcane focus, allowing the user to cast magic. <br /><br />You must have an arcane focus in one hand to cast any spells.

            <p>Requires attunement. A metallic mace with a hollow orb for a head. Deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage. Except where otherwise noted, it is functionally the same as a regular mace. <br /><br />As a bonus action, you can “prime” the tonitrus, causing blue sparks to crackle around its tip. A primed tonitrus starts with 3 ‘charges’ and deals an additional 1d8 lightning damage on a hit, expending a charge on each swing (whether it hits or misses). It has the following additional property: <br /><br />* <em>Project Force</em>: As an action, you can expend a number of ‘charges’ remaining on the primed Tonitrus to project a 40ft long, 5ft wide blast of lightning. All enemies in the line must make a dexterity saving throw. The DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your charisma modifier. On a failed save, each creature affected takes 2d6 lightning damage. The amount of lightning damage increases by 1d6 for each ‘charge’ you expend. You must roll 1d4 and add the result to your frenzy meter.</p>

            <p><em>“The Wren always follows The Nightingale.”</em><br /><br />Functionally, a pair of +1 daggers. Each deals 1d4+1 damage and has the light, finesse, ad thrown (30/60) properties. <br /><br />When The Nightingale is thrown, the player can, as a free action, teleport to the location of The Nightingale once per round, as long as s/he is holding The Wren. This usage not leave the bearer open to attacks of opportunity. The user can additionally make a follow-up attack with the Nightingale for free - not counting as two attacks or against the multi-attack ability. After teleporting, The Wren is automatically returned to your hand. <br /><br />Alternatively, The Wren can be thrown, and it will return to the player’s hand as long as the player is holding The Nightingale in the other hand. Any creature or small item The Wren is stuck in will teleport with it as long as it can be freely moved, at the DM’s discretion - it cannot move mountains or sections of a wall, for example.<br /><br />Lem got these weapons from the Wizard Oneth on <em>The Last Word</em> and has been using them ever since. He even let Hubert wield them briefly, when his legs were destroyed.</p>
