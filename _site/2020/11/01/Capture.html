    <h2>01 Nov 2020</h2>
    <blockquote>
  <p>His Eye is Watching.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The leadership of <em>His Eye</em>, the revolutionaries plotting to overthrow the Pontiff Sulyvahn and his tyranical Church, are made up of the dwarf Dundarrin of the Cloudstone Deep Miner’s Guild, a Disparian Hunter named Makar, the shopkeeper named Blinsky, Kaster the tavern owner, a pygmy named Alva and the disguised Marinese Knight named Simon.</p>

<p>Dundarrin claims he came to help liberate the city because Lundisian archeologists were encroaching on Cloudstone territory and picking up buried artifacts that they can not control. The others are likewise convinced that Sulyvahn poses a serious threat to peace in Mondial and must be stopped. Their interests aligned, the party agrees to help, for now.</p>

<p>A plan is quickly put together. The party believes they could gain access to the barricaded Upper Cathedral Ward with Hubert’s claim to having killed Magnus, the former member of the royal family found at the Circle of Illusion. Dundarrin and the rest plan on intercepting a shipment of magical items they know is heading for the city in a day’s time. The supplies could outfit a small army and help the people liberate their city from the Church and Royal Guard.</p>

<p>The plan is quickly thrown into chaos when Isho falls into a trap while passing by <em>The Autumn Leaf</em> - which has been boarded up and is being patrolled by the Lundisian Royal Guard. A fight with guards and Church Assassins ensues. One of the guards imbibes a vial of purplish liquid that transforms him into a hideous beast. Though the party is victorious, their fight sets <em>The Autumn Leaf</em> ablaze and reinforcements are summoned.</p>

<p>Most of the party manages to escape, but Ulrach is captured. Hubert accompanies him, pretending to still work for The Church. And so the party splits - Ulrach and Hubert are led to the Upper Cathedral Ward and the White Tower from which the city gets its name, while the rest of the party - Lem, Isho and Rawson - are left to seek out a place to lay low until the night, when they will attempt to join Dundarrin and <em>His Eye</em> for a heist.</p>
