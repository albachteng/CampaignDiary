          <h1>Ulrach and hubert bound</h1>
    <h2>02 Nov 2020</h2>
    <blockquote>
  <p>From the Trades you are led through the Palisades, past the burnt body of a mage, now frozen solid in place. You are accompanied by first ten and eventually twenty royal guard, all of their faces covered by impassive silver masks. Their leather armor is clean and tightly-fitted. Some of them shake - whether from the cold or from fear of the large bovine monstrosity they have captured is unclear. <br /><br />They move quickly and silently through the streets up to the Eastern Barricade. No one seems to recognize you, or perhaps you manage to blend in with the group. The entire group is quickly given a once-over by the guards for magical items, and then you are given entry to The Upper Cathedral Ward. A long bridge connects the dark facade of the Cathedral to the central White Tower from which the city gets its name. <br /><br />You are led across well-maintained quadrangles and parks, passing snow-covered gothic buildings of stone. You are led through the upper levels and balconies of the Grand Cathedral itself - high walls, crystal lamps and towering stained glass, catching a brief glimpse of a man on a pedestal in the midst of his daily sermon, inviting the congregation to partake of Communion passed around in great silver bowls - before finally being led down into the dark depths of the Catacombs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ulrach is led beyond an iron portcullis and into an open domed space, a medical theater. Behind rows of raised seating is a small jail. Ulrach takes the fourth cell, behind a steadily chanting madman, the desperately screaming former owner of <em>The Autumn Leaf</em> and a sleeping pygmy. Here he is tortured and healed repeatedly by a set of royal guards, while a Scholar with a telescopic monocle enters with vials and syringes to prep the minotaur for “surgery.” Ulrach answers none of their questions.</p>

<p>Hubert’s con seems to have worked, and he is invited to rest in the barracks deeper within the Catacombs, further down than he has ever been allowed before. Wandering, he finds resting Royal Guards, letting their masks down and discussing someone named “Nathaniel”. They talk of him ironically, as if he were a pet in need of care. Hubert discovers large supplies of <em>Communion</em> and healing potions, as well as equipment for excavation before running into a long-time tormentor: Inquisitor Narissa. She berates Hubert and repeats her promise to expunge all wealdscum from the Church when she is made High Inquisitor.</p>

<p>After some verbal sparring, Hubert explores the Catacombs further, discovering an ornate throne room filled with black marble and gold, walls adorned with mosaics of suns, moons and trees and surrounded by statues of deceased royalty of the house Rutvyen.</p>

<p>He finds a guarded dwarf, whose legs have been brutally crushed, pulling himself across the floor on a wheeled wooden board and building what appears to be a large copper still. The dwarf tells him that he is working on improving production efficiency. He is adding delicate glass bulbs, dials, and some kind of motor that appears to function as a centrifuge. Hubert feigns understanding in the presence of the guards.</p>

<p>He explores a few other private rooms (including a room beyond an elaborately locked door completely covered in glowing runes) before the time comes that he must meet with High Inquisitor Noska. Hubert is debriefed on the assassination of Magnus, brother to the now deceased king. Noska asks if Magnus knew of the church’s “project”, to which Hubert simply states that he does not know what Magnus knew or simply what he suspected. Noska accepts this answer, and comments that it is good that Pontiff Sulyvahn was able to take control of White Tower - ending the political influence of an unnecessary royal family and allowing the project to go forward. He invites Hubert to “observe the surgery.”</p>

<p>Inquisitor Narissa joins them, as do over a dozen members of the Church hierarchy, in the gallery of the surgical theater.</p>

<p>Ulrach, exhausted from hours of torture, has been left tied to a gurney. A familiar voice from another cell berates him for breaking his manacles - “you’ll make it harder on all of us.” A feminine voice, presumably the pygmy, asks Andre to give it a rest, while the madman continues his steady chant:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Shrouded by night but with steady stride… colored by blood but always clear of mind… proud servant of the church… beasts are a curse and a curse is a shackle. Only ye are the true blades of the church…”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ulrach attempts to escape by breaking his restraints again when the guards return to wheel him out for surgery, but he is strapped down once more. The monocled scholar, referred to as Urgrey, speaks excitedly as he wheels the minotaur into the brightly-lit chamber: “This will be a great day for the art! I have yet to attempt this on a minotaur for wont of subjects.” He leans in with a wicked smile. “I think that you will make an excellent batch of <em>Communion</em>.”</p>

<p>Hubert watches his friend wheeled out into the surgery with mounting dread. The Scholar injects Ulrach with tinctures while the Church hierarchy observes in silence. Urgrey brings out forceps, a saw, a scalpel, clamps and a strange contraption with an enormous hand-cranked screw, coated in blood. A basin is set under Ulrach’s head.</p>

<p>Hubert, throwing caution to the wind, takes a dagger to Noska’s throat and holds him hostage, demanding his friend be freed. It is at this moment that the door to the chamber opens.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Into the chamber steps a rather plain, middle-aged man, hooded in white and purple, wearing an assortment of gemmed rings. He wears his hood down, revealing a bald head bearing a simple white circlet. You can see two masked Assassins flanking him from behind, who close and secure the doors to the room. As soon as he enters, every member of the Church hierarchy stops what they are doing and stands at attention. Scholar Urgrey’s face turns white. “Blessings of the Moon on us all. Please, be seated.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Do you know who I am?” The answer is obvious. He is Pontiff Sulyvahn. He speaks to Ulrach: “You are perhaps more Lost and Away than any of your kind before. The Au’vanwa shun this place. Why have you come here?”</p>

<p>With a casual wave of his hand, the Pontiff dismisses everyone in the room, including his guards. The doors are quietly closed behind him as he questions Hubert (still holding a knife to High Inquisitor Noska’s throat) and Ulrach (still strapped down) while methodically removing his rings and circlet and placing them one-by-one on a chair. To Hubert:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You are a very interesting person, you know that? A person with many unusual friends, I imagine. Just look at all the help you’ve gotten. From Goblins, from Drow, perhaps from the little grey ones. I should like to meet them. I suspect I shall. Oh, you won’t tell me anything, of that I’ve no doubt. Not willingly. But they are in the city?” And here he studies Hubert’s face carefully. “Ah. Yes. Definitely in the city, then. Or perhaps close by. Well if they are all as impressive as you, I suppose we had best be ready for them.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As if from out of thin air, Pontiff Sulyvahn draws two glowing greatswords - one blazing with fire and the other pulsing with a pale purplish light. Swifter than seems possible, the fight begins. Hubert cuts Noska’s throat and tries to free his friend before the Pontiff closes the distance.</p>

<p>When it is over, Hubert and Ulrach come to bound on the floor of the throne room, where Sulyvahn sits imperiously.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Malorn and I share much in common, you know. We were both made strangers in a strange land. And we both fell in love with our adoptive homes. We both had to make incredible sacrifices for a people who would never understand us. You might even say we both destroyed them, to some degree. But out of love, always out of love.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Deep within this Earth are powers that you could only imagine. And with those powers, I can protect my new home. Better: elevate it to its next stage. Allow humanity to flourish in a way that Malorn always wanted us to. I will raise this paranoid, frightened people into its next childhood, masters of their own fate. Some must die for that to happen. I suspect Marina and Disparia will have to go entirely, in fact! But I deem this a worthy tradeoff. These chosen few of Lundis, my darling foster children, will finally be able to stand on their own two feet, and at last need not fear the light.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While he speaks, Inquisitor Noska and another Church Inquisitor flank Hubert, one with a wooden board and the other with a heavy sledgehammer. Hubert closes his eyes and remembers Asta, the Mother Superior at the orphanage where he grew up. In his memory, she smiles at him kindly.</p>
