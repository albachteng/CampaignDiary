          <h1>On the road</h1>
    <h2>20 Jun 2020</h2>
    <blockquote>
The day dawns bright and crisp, sunlight streaming through silk curtains. You wake, as you have for the last tenday, in a soft feather bed. The scents and sounds of the sea mingle gently with those of the market, the smoke of the forges. Downstairs, you can hear the servants setting out your breakfast. You are guests of the Good Duke Geoffrey, whose life you recently saved, and into whose services you now find yourself bound. All good things must come to an end. Today is the date of your agreed-upon departure.</blockquote>

<p>The party managed to avoid conflict for nearly a full day.</p>

<p>The roads of Marina between Redwater and the Lundisian border are safe enough - and mostly untravelled. But the party noticed a campfire and approached in stealth to discover a rival troupe.</p>

<p>Among them was a hulking Disparian Hunter, a Scholar of Talen, a dragonborn of the Auâ€™vanwa and an assassin of the Lundisian Church. They shared a fire and swapped stories, only to discover treachery in the dead of night. Their hosts were after their treasures.</p>

<p>The Disparian wielded a frightening weapon that sprayed blood and fire in explosive strikes and the Scholar Melwyn managed to escape, but the company managed to capture the assassin alive.</p>

<p>Perhaps they were surprised at his off-puttingly friendly manner. The half-elf assassin of Lundis offered them a deal, swinging upside down where he was bound. In exchange for sparing his life, he would help them track and kill the Scholar who had made off with some of their belongings. In addition, he would offer them two more lives - any two lives they wished.</p>

<p>Whatever the reason (this is D&amp;D after all), they accepted his proposal. And so Hubert, the half-elf orphan of White Tower, joins the party.</p>
