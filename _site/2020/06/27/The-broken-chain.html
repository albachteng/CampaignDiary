          <h1>The broken chain</h1>
    <h2>27 Jun 2020</h2>
    <blockquote>Oarsrest sits in the shadow of an enormous mountain, Seawatch. Its high smooth cliffs give the impression of an enormous shield. Compared to Redwater, this is a sprawling metropolis. It lacks the great walls or high stone towers of Redwater, but more than makes up for it in the huge number of homes, shipyards and forges. Its harbor stretches as far as you can see before the coastline curves around towards the north. Everywhere, people are furiously at work in some trade or commerce.</blockquote>

<p>The company makes for the seediest tavern they can find, tracking the Scholar Melwyn. <em>The Broken Chain</em> sits right off the docks and is full with carousing and gambling sailors.</p>

<p>Lem and Hubert investigate a suspicious man in a dark corner of the bar who seems to be guarding a young woman in blue robes. They learn that the man is a bounty hunter and the girl is a young mage that he is taking back to the Circle of Enchantment from her home in Midcopse to the far west. Unfortunately, his work is lawful in Marina, and the party leave the poor child to her fate.</p>

<p>The rest of the party spreads out through the town but are quickly jumped by thugs. The thieves claim to recognize members of the party from the day before. After the fight, the party begin to piece together the narrative: Melwyn beat them to town by a couple of days - and has been racking up ill-will from every criminal enterprise in town, disguised as various members of the party.</p>

<p>They track Melwyn to a seaside cove hideout and attack. He has taken things one step further and replaced the Oarsrest kingpin using his magical disguises. Melwyn feeds a strange potion to two of his men that corrupts them into lycanthropes.</p>

<p>Ultimately, they succeed but are forced to flee the town quickly - Melwyn uses his dying breath to inform them that he has summoned more men to chase them down.</p>
