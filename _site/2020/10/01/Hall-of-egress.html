          <h1>Hall of egress</h1>
    <h2>01 Oct 2020</h2>
    <blockquote>
  <p>The door at the end of the road opens into a wide square chamber of polished marble and granite, alternating light and dark tiles. Lit sconces line the chamber. At the far end of the room is a heavy metal door. Above the door, written in Common, are the words: “Whatever is required.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Hall of Egress appears to be composed of three rooms with challenges themed after the major gods of Mondial’s pantheon. For Malachi, the Chessmaster, the players took the position of chess pieces and attempted to cross the field. When they deviated from the legal path or were “captured” by their unseen adversary, they were punished with magical lightning and crushing blows from the marble chess pieces.</p>

<p>For Marinal, the party needed to dive into murky waters to flip a switch that would open the way forward. The waters were occupied by an aboleth, which poisoned Rawson.</p>

<p>The final room held only a single basin of water sitting in the center of the room. Within the water, a single stone button.</p>
