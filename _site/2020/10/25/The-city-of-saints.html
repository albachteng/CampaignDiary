          <h1>The city of saints</h1>
    <h2>25 Oct 2020</h2>
    <blockquote>
  <p>The moon hangs low, shimmering in the snow and seeming to brush against the towering spires of White Tower. The city is enormous, and made up of two layers - a lower city surrounding an elevated ward. The lower ring holds featureless houses of wood and stone. Pointed arches, ribbed vaults, flying buttresses and stained glass dominate the architecture of the city above, and over it all is a single building, larger than any of the cities you’ve come across in your time in Mondial. The Great Cathedral to His Eye, House of the Church of Malorn. You have arrived at the City of Saints.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Throughout the lower wards, pinprick lights of lanterns and the warm glow of fires within the city’s homes mingle with the sparkle of snowflakes. The smell and feel of cold, and the sound-dampening effect of ice-coated streets combined with the high pale tower at the city’s heart all together leaves you with a sense of awe and smallness. It is a beautiful city, an impressive, enormous city, and yet on the night you arrive, it is as quiet as the grave.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The city gates are closed at night, but the party finds refuge at an inn called <em>The Black Forest</em> in a ward outside its gates and to the north, an area called The Open Ring. The barkeeper is a nervous half-elf whose pointed ears were cut long ago - a common act of cruelty performed on non-humans in Lundis.</p>

<p>In the party’s explorations, they gradually learn that The City of Saints has been taken over completely by the Church. The High Inquisitor has declared himself Pontiff and placed the Queen under house arrest in the White Tower at the city’s center. The Upper Cathedral Ward, where the Church has barricaded itself from the increasingly angry and frightened populace, is barred to anyone not working for the Church. In response, a group of revolutionaries calling themselves <em>His Eye</em> has been taking matters into their own hands, publicly murdering mages and fighting against the increasingly oppressive presence of Royal Guards monitoring the streets for unrest.</p>

<p>After a long day of investigations, they discover that <em>The Black Forest</em> is, in fact, a meeting place for <em>His Eye</em>.</p>
