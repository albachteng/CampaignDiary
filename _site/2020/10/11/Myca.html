          <h1>Myca</h1>
    <h2>11 Oct 2020</h2>
    <blockquote>
  <p>Rawson expires towards dawn, shuddering and drawing his last, ragged breath. His skin has turned a slimy, translucent grey-blue. The light leaves his eyes. In death he stares uncomprehendingly at the water in the small wooden washbasin that relieved his burning flesh for his final night. Ulrach is there with him when he dies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The party lights a pyre for their lost friend. They investigate their surroundings. The crescent moon continues to disturb Ulrach and Hubert, but they quickly find other problems: strange, crab-like creatures with hollow orbs in place of bodies. They appear as walking black holes with legs, the edges of their empty shells shimmering slightly. There are many of them, and they emerge from the trees.</p>

<p>Ulrach can hear them speaking in his head: “Human?”</p>

<p>One by one, the party takes a leap of faith, diving into the empty hollow of these strange creatures.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You open your eyes to brilliant white light. You are on your feet, leaning against a smooth cave wall. Both you and it are absolutely covered with thick patches of luminous fungus. The growth pulsates and squirms around you as if breathing. You can see your companions buried within the bright fungus as well… including Rawson, alive.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a sixth body in the room, almost impossible to identify beneath heaps of fungus growing over and, on closer inspection, through her. It is a female drow, but half of her face has been overtaken by growth. The mildew has erupted out of one of her eye sockets.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In one direction is a hallway that terminates in a closed portcullis. In the other direction, a heavy stone door with an iron wheel. Above the door, cut into the stone in Common are the words “Show Your Humanity.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The mildewed corpse speaks: “Node Maintainer; Hall of Egress, Remote Colony 364. All systems operational. This branch has experienced no breaches in two million, nine hundred and twenty two thousand, six hundred and forty four days.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Myca, the Myconid Containment Apparatus introduces itself. It is a living fungus, capable of speech only through manipulating the corpse it has found.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Our functions involve maintaining subsurface nodes to prevent contamination on the surface above. Currently experiencing catastrophic breaches in fourteen remote nodes: Remote Node 322, Node 312, Node 218, Node 244, Node 233, Node 121, Node 95, Node 88, Node 16, Node 13, Node 7, Central Node 1, and Central Node Zero.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Having passed its strange test and proven their humanity, Myca permits the adventurers to leave. Lem, in a stroke of either genius or madness, grabs the head and brings it with them for further study, over Myca’s protests.</p>
