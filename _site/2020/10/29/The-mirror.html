          <h1>The mirror</h1>
    <h2>29 Oct 2020</h2>
    <blockquote>
  <p>As the light of the fire dies, a soft glow ignites somewhere deep within the dark reflection of the mirror. The shift of light briefly throws strange shadows off the cracked stone arms wrapped around the edges of the metal frame. For a moment, you might wonder if they moved. But then your eyes are drawn back to the depths of the mirror.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The clarity of the image adjusts until you can clearly see a small, lavishly decorated and comfortable office room. There is a fireplace in the far corner crackling warmly. On the mantle above it rests a painting of a dragon and a kraken fighting at a storm-tossed sea. The back wall is entirely occupied by a wooden filing system, cabinets and shelves. Here and there you see sitting out beakers and vials, books and ledgers, the skulls of small and foreign creatures, a stringed instrument, a glass orb, a beautiful, ornate sword, a walking stick, a chessboard.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a window, but you can barely see a corner of it from your vantage point. It appears to be night outside, wherever this is. The drapes and decorations in the room are deep purples and crimsons trimmed with gold.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the center of the room, facing away from you, towards the fire, is a large, ornately carved wooden desk. Papers and leather-bound tomes are tossed across its surface, while a dark-haired man sits and reads, taking careful notes. After a short time, he stops, leans back in his chair, and rubs his eyes with a gloved hand. He then turns to stare at the fire for a time. Finally, he rises and goes to the fireplace, turning a knob to close a grate. The light dims. He turns to face you for the first time.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He is an elegant young man, perhaps no more than twenty. His clothes are rich, black silk with gold trim. His eyes scan the room as if looking for something, and then come to a sudden stop locked onto yours. He hesitates. Then he flicks his wrist and the fire goes out. The image vanishes.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A second later, it reappears. The male figure is directly in front of you, seemingly inches away from your face. He smiles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The party makes their way through Winndale, a small village to the south of the capital, where Lem, Hubert and Ulrach experience their first taste of the Lundisian’s distaste for non-humans. It is only a day’s journey to the their destination, so the party pushes forward.</p>

<p>While resting at the inn, Ulrach attempts once more to uncover the mysteries of the mirror. He watches the mirror under the light of the moon. When it dips behind a cloud, a transformation takes place and the mirror reveals its captive.</p>

<p>Whoever it is, he cannot communicate in writing or verbally with Ulrach - everything he jots down and shows the minotaur is meaningless, and the two cannot hear one another. The man in the mirror attempts to convince Ulrach to perform a blood magic ritual through pantomime, but Ulrach is disturbed and chooses to cover the mirror.</p>
