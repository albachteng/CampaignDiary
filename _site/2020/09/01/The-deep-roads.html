          <h1>The deep roads</h1>
    <h2>01 Sep 2020</h2>
    <blockquote>
  <p>You awake in near-darkness. Smoldering ashes cast long, thin, faint shadows away from camp. Along the walls, swirling patterned grooves cut into the stone form a channel for a creeping luminous moss. The effect is like a faintly yellow glowing calligraphy coating the walls and ceilings of the wide hallway. Rogga described this place as a road. It is large and wide enough to accommodate a grown dragon. Torchlight barely reaches from one end to the other. Camped, as you are, at the crossroads, the enormity of the Deep Roads becomes apparent.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And so: North to Malachi’s Watch, South to Chain’s End, or West to White Tower.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the depths below the collapsed grotto, the party again encounters Rogga, who welcomes them to the Deep Roads.</p>

<p>Hubert sets the tone by standing by the West road. The others agree: Lundis is their destination. In the dark and maze-like depths, they discover the strange remnants of a long-buried civilization: statues to an unfamiliar god, a robed figure masked by a serenely smiling sun.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You hear them long before you see them: singing, softly, wordlessly, their chant echoing off the stone walls. They are apparently making no effort to hide their music, and you can tell there are at least a dozen of them, a mix of male, female and indeterminate voices, young and old. The mood is rapturous and solemn.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dark-robed figures, obscuring their faces with heavy cloaks against the chill and damp of the Deep Roads stand in a semi-circle facing a wall. They have lit candles around a section of wall that has been roughly cut into to create a sea of orbs - moons, eyes - all connected by the grooves and ridges previously designed. As a result of this effacement, the luminous moss has crown into the circular patterns. But this fungus has been changed somehow, from the orange-yellow glow everywhere else into a cool blue-green. Further down along the path, the road narrows into a series of arched doorways.</p>
