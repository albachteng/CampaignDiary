          <h1>The maze settlements</h1>
    <h2>18 Sep 2020</h2>
    <blockquote>
  <p>The sound of the heavy door slamming behind you reverberates against stone walls. From beyond, you can hear the inhuman sounds of the shrieking, malformed flies and glowing centipedes as the fire overtakes the hanging gardens. The smell of smoke rises faintly from the edges of the door. At first, you feel hammering rattle its hinges, but it ends suddenly. A moment later, you can hear the hanging bridges crumble and crash to the cavern floor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The inhabitants of the Deep Roads apparently carved these rooms and tunnels from the solid rock. They extend for miles in every direction, a network of spartan living quarters, storage, lichen farms, animal pens and even underground springs.</p>

<p>Periodically, the party is attacked in magical darkness by the maze’s defenders. They take a hit-and-run tactic but are foiled by Rawson’s superior vision. Ultimately, the party manages to catch one alive.</p>

<p>They are called drow on the surface, but the captive resembles humanity more than expected. Its language is a patois of Goblin, Au’vanwa and something older still. Between Lem and Ulrach, a rudimentary interrogation is performed that gives them a way out of the maze. By rolling enormous barrels of smokepowder to a barricaded door, they blast their way out of the settlements.</p>

<p>Beyond the door is an endless staircase, crossing back and forth over a cliff face. The drow emerge from the settlements to try and stop them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As the sound of the explosion reverberates down the hallways, a faint glow pierces the gloom. Before you is a long hallway absolutely coated in the glowing gold and yellow fungus you last saw at the base of a sunken cathedral. Here, the lichen has grown so thickly that it has started swelling into bulbous stalks, which pulse gently. After the darkness of the maze-like settlements, this light is painful. The path leads down straight ahead and terminates in a staircase leading up and out of sight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is a brutal fight up the stairs and down the passageways that nearly leaves several party-members dead, but they are victorious in the end.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The staircase switches back and forth. The fungus lights your way, less dense past the entrance hallway but still ubiquitous. The cavern is high and narrow, and footsteps echo up and down the shaft. After what seems like hours, you reach the top of the steps to a vast open chamber. Within its confines are dozens of crushed and crumbling buildings. They are a style of architecture unlike anything you have ever seen, walls and towers decorated with swirling calligraphic grooves and edges, wherein the fungus grows to create a glowing rune-like effect. Dominating the small city before you is a high cathedral.</p>
