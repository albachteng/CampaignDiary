          <h1>The lighthouse</h1>
    <h2>11 May 2020</h2>
    <blockquote>
You wake up to the sound of waves. A single seagull crying overhead - followed by the call of a raven. The taste of salt, the scent of the ocean. Every part of you hurts, you are sore as if beaten. Your clothes and belongings are damp and filled with sand. You were chewed up and spit out by the Ocean herself. Every breath you take is a miracle. Distant memories of the voyage return to you, as if from another life. You can still hear an echo of the voices of sailors, shouting orders, fearfully.

<p>The party awakes on mysterious shores and travels to a nearby Lighthouse. As they approach, the sound of bullets ricocheting off the ground signals to them that they are not alone. Lem climbs the tower, invisible, while Rawson and Isho storm the building from the front. Inside, they are faced with a strange blue-hooded knight, quietly singing to itself and bearing smokepowder weapons unknown to them. The knight has bright orange glowing eyes and is accompanied by a handful of rabbid dogs.</p>

<p>Thanks in no small part to the arrival of backup in the form of Ulrach, the Au’vanwa minotaur, the party is able to defeat the mysterious knight. Together, the now reinforced party makes its way to Ulrach’s tribal caravan, where Talpa Adamina, their leader, welcomes the strangers to the land of Mondial, and the Kingdom of Marina.</p>
