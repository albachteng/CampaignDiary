    <li>Up to go down. Down to go up. A beautiful mirror.</li>
    <li>We have gone about it all wrong. Einan’s final spell was no tragedy. The spell didn’t fail; it worked as intended. Perhaps Malorn is no longer the only one.</li>
    <li>The Raven King had a Queen…</li>

<p>The party finds the scattered notes of Kolat in the towers, along with diabolical traps and tricks to keep them from finding him. At the top of an invisible staircase, after a fight with a failed golem, through illusory chambers filled with fire and choked of all air and light, they find a runic symbol that inverts gravity throughout the buildings and allows them to enter the second tower upside down, climbing it, bizarrely, into the depths of the earth…</p>

<p>Where they find Kolat, accompanied by his “faithful servant.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The passageway opens into a luminous grotto - fungus on the floor and walls radiates a sickly yellow dim light throughout the room. The musk of damp earth and spores fill your senses. It is cold, and the chamber echoes with intonations from a shriveled, dark-haired and purple-robed man at the center of the room. He is bent over a round mirror which at first glance seems to have two large handles or legs protruding out of it at an odd angle. You can see that the mirror’s edge has been etched with runes. Standing next to the man is a ghostly horned figure, long and lithe, watching the old man work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kolat is a powerful illusionist and protects the mirror with a terrifying fanaticism, claiming he is close to unlocking its secrets. Isho comes close to death, but is saved by Hubert’s quick thinking: disarming Kolat of his arcane focus prevents him from spellcasting long enough to end the battle.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Kolat crawls, bleeding and coughing, towards the mirror. He grips the stone arms fused to its sides, wrapping his hands of flesh around the hands of stone. He presses his face to his own reflection, breath rattling. “Oh, you ignorant slaves. I was so close. Einan. Help me.” As he dies, his blood dripping over the glass, the figure of the horned creature appears behind him, which Kolat sees reflected in the mirror. The Gentleman bends his face down to meet Kolat. He smiles. Kolat returns the smile, manically, gazing at the Fey creature’s image in the mirror and sighs “My faithful servant!”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A glittering, ethereal clawed hand erupts from the end of the Horned Man’s arm, wisps of gas and light struggling for materiality, and rips out Kolat’s throat. In the mirror, the gentleman’s smile broadens, cracks open the flesh of his cheeks, hardens into scales. The form of a glittering golden-scaled and black-feathered serpent erupts from the Gentleman’s body - wings and teeth and flame. The Gentleman’s cries of glee elongate into a long, low reverberating roar so powerful that the stones of the grotto crack and fall around you. The Earth itself opens up to swallow the room. The scaly, feathery creature grows without end, filling the space of the grotto, blotting out the meager light.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And then, as soon as the image appeared, the mirror dims, the vision of the feathered Wyrm disperses, the flames and the roar disintegrate into a sigh of air. The effort is spent. The Fey creature is gone, seemingly dispersed into the darkness. You are alone in the grotto, the earth opens beneath you deeper, darker, but still with the faint shimmer of the luminescence of the creeping mold.</p>
