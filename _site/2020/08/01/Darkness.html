          <h1>Darkness</h1>
    <h2>01 Aug 2020</h2>
    <blockquote>
In the darkness, a blue spark crackles into life. And then another. You trace the arc of energy around a globe, the size of a cannonball. The light reveals sunken, hollow eyes, black hairs charging with static. A long, sinuous, feline body of bone, a wrinkled skull for a head, and everywhere, thick black hair and bright, blue lightning. It draws its grinning skull in near, flashes bright, and then vanishes again into the night. Somewhere in the blackness, you hear and feel the resonance of a deep, rolling purr. 
</blockquote>

<p>The fight with the darkbeast was deadly. The creature hit hard physically and could summon lightning to supercharge its attacks or attack from a distance. Even without these obvious advantages, it is no easy thing to kill an enemy you cannot see. And Ulrach was alone.</p>

<p>It was Rawson that saved him. The partyâ€™s lycanthrope expert kept the party together, located Hubert quickly and made a beeline for the column of darkness The Gentleman had summoned and used his superior vision to spot the darkbeast stalking Ulrach in the shadows.</p>

<p>With the party finally reunited, they cross the East Chain (defended by undead knights) and make their way at last to the Circle of Illusion.</p>

<p>The Circle consists of a village surrounding a central pair of towers connected by a skybridge. The towers are encased in a transparent force field and are patrolled by more hulking golems, which wander aimlessly.</p>

<p>The party finds only one man still living in the village, who explains that the mages of the Circle fled weeks ago - all except one. The mage Kolat hides within the towers, working on something so terrible that all of the other mages abandoned him. Lucky for them, the survivor knows a way in and agrees to show them.</p>

<p>Hubert discovers that the survivor is Magnus Rutvyen - uncle to the Queen of Lundis, who was banished, it is said, for blasphemy to the Church. When the rest of the party heads forward into the tower, Hubert stays behind - and kills Magnus, taking a locket from his neck.</p>
