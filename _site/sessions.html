        <aside>
    A hush falls over the party-goers. A loud pop and fading whine soars up into the midnight sky. After a moment of silence there is a crackle and a series of multicolored explosions light up the garden, casting long shadows against the Dukeâ€™s Estate. Red, blue, green and yellow fires in the shapes of flowers, shooting stars and glittering suns are painted across the sky as more and more fireworks are launched into the air. The crowd gasps and applauds. For many, it is the first time in their lives that they have seen such a display. A moment later, the screaming begins.

        <aside>You descend forty feet down the old well, noting the intricate carvings along its edges, matching them to the Lighthouse at the tip of the peninsula Marinal's Call. At its base is a staircase spiraling even further into the depths. The hall to the south is caved in, but to the north you are met with high, stained-glass windows. As you continue your exploration, the ceiling opens up into a high dome. Reflected in the glass, in frescoes, in statues carved into columns, the cathedral's repeating motif is that of a serenely smiling sun and feathered wings.</aside>

        <aside>The town is abuzz with activity. It sits on the water, wrapping its walls close to the shoreline to surround a modest harbor. Smaller sailing ships lazily drift in and out. A guard tower rises from the water at the end of a stone jetty. In the center of town, an open square appears crowded around a large tavern, smoke pouring from its many high chimneys. The smell of smoked meats and fish fill the air. Closer to the city gate, you can hear the cries of men at work on the walls, and at the forges.

        <aside>
You wake up to the sound of waves. A single seagull crying overhead - followed by the call of a raven. The taste of salt, the scent of the ocean. Every part of you hurts, you are sore as if beaten. Your clothes and belongings are damp and filled with sand. You were chewed up and spit out by the Ocean herself. Every breath you take is a miracle. Distant memories of the voyage return to you, as if from another life. You can still hear an echo of the voices of sailors, shouting orders, fearfully.

        <aside>
    The heat of the sun, coupled with the 
    stillness of the air, weighs on you 
    oppressively. The sparse cries of seagulls 
    punctuate the steady, lazy lapping of waves 
    against the ship on which you are passengers. 
    The salt air mingles with the sweat of sailors. 
    You were hired to protect The Last Word and its 
    cargo by a group of Filian Wizards. It is day ten.
