  <p>Before Einan killed them, the dragons shot white-hot streams of flame at the central tower - the city’s namesake. You watched as the spire first tilted, suspended horribly for a moment, before crumbling from its base. Tumbled over in this way, the tower’s destruction bisects the great Cathedral to His Eye and the Upper Cathedral Ward, crushing buildings. Fires spread quickly.</p>

  <p>You face Pontiff Sulyvahn himself, who has revealed himself as impossibly old and from another world. He wields paired greatswords, one shrouded in flame, the other pulsing with violet energy. He has calmly removed his circlet and rings and set them one by one at the edge of the frozen courtyard fountain. His feet barely seem to touch the ground as he attacks, moving faster and more gracefully than you would think possible, changing direction and seemingly ignoring the momentum of the paired greatswords he twists without a thought.</p>

  <p>The smoldering flames of your explosive trap cast dancing shadows through the trees, while the accumulating snow makes the scene washed-out, colorless. After the activity of the brief but intense battle, your breath steadies and your panting and sweating gives way to the deep chill of the northwest hills. A lone raven calls out from somewhere high among the trees. Dundarrin, Makar and Simon finish consolidating the last of the shipment they deem worth taking and hitching the remaining horses to the wagon.</p>

  <p>It is close to noon by the time Ulrach is captured. You watch from your hiding place - for some, perhaps that is just around the corner of a nearby alley. For others, maybe you managed to scramble up onto the roof of a building, laying down in the ice and snow, shivering as the Royal Guard surround your Minotaur friend. You can hear Hubert’s shout as he leaps onto Ulrach’s back, playing the role of a faithful Church Assassin - perhaps almost too believably. Once he is surrounded, it is only a matter of seconds before there are nearly 20 guards surrounding him. Ulrach is led away in chains. Hubert is apparently accepted as one of them. They march for the Palisade and, ultimately, the Upper Cathedral Ward.</p>

  <p>From the Trades you are led through the Palisades, past the burnt body of a mage, now frozen solid in place. You are accompanied by first ten and eventually twenty royal guard, all of their faces covered by impassive silver masks. Their leather armor is clean and tightly-fitted. Some of them shake - whether from the cold or from fear of the large bovine monstrosity they have captured is unclear.</p>

  <p>The moon hangs low, shimmering in the snow and seeming to brush against the towering spires of White Tower. The city is enormous, and made up of two layers - a lower city surrounding an elevated ward. The lower ring holds featureless houses of wood and stone. Pointed arches, ribbed vaults, flying buttresses and stained glass dominate the architecture of the city above, and over it all is a single building, larger than any of the cities you’ve come across in your time in Mondial. The Great Cathedral to His Eye, House of the Church of Malorn. You have arrived at the City of Saints.</p>

  <p>As the light of the fire dies, a soft glow ignites somewhere deep within the dark reflection of the mirror. The shift of light briefly throws strange shadows off the cracked stone arms wrapped around the edges of the metal frame. For a moment, you might wonder if they moved. But then your eyes are drawn back to the depths of the mirror.</p>

  <p>The drow approach the Cathedral and form a ring around it, several hundred yards back. There are dozens and dozens of them, eyes glowing with an intense orange light. They stand stiffly, gazing ahead without understanding or feeling. After a time, the infected drow begin rhythmically pounding their staves, axes and swords against the ground, the sound swelling into a steady beat that echoes off the cavern walls. Out of the darkness beyond steps another blue, tentacled alien creature, dragging behind it the charred corpse of a dwarf - the one left behind. The drow make room for the monstrosity, who steps a few feet forward and, with its bare hands, rips open a hole in the back of the dwarf’s skull and slides something alive and kicking into the cavity of his head. The dwarf stands, eyes glowing bright.</p>

  <p>The sound of the heavy door slamming behind you reverberates against stone walls. From beyond, you can hear the inhuman sounds of the shrieking, malformed flies and glowing centipedes as the fire overtakes the hanging gardens. The smell of smoke rises faintly from the edges of the door. At first, you feel hammering rattle its hinges, but it ends suddenly. A moment later, you can hear the hanging bridges crumble and crash to the cavern floor.</p>

  <p>You awake in near-darkness. Smoldering ashes cast long, thin, faint shadows away from camp. Along the walls, swirling patterned grooves cut into the stone form a channel for a creeping luminous moss. The effect is like a faintly yellow glowing calligraphy coating the walls and ceilings of the wide hallway. Rogga described this place as a road. It is large and wide enough to accommodate a grown dragon. Torchlight barely reaches from one end to the other. Camped, as you are, at the crossroads, the enormity of the Deep Roads becomes apparent.</p>

  <p>In the darkness, a blue spark crackles into life. And then another. You trace the arc of energy around a globe, the size of a cannonball. The light reveals sunken, hollow eyes, black hairs charging with static. A long, sinuous, feline body of bone, a wrinkled skull for a head, and everywhere, thick black hair and bright, blue lightning. It draws its grinning skull in near, flashes bright, and then vanishes again into the night. Somewhere in the blackness, you hear and feel the resonance of a deep, rolling purr.</p>

  <p>Entering into the forest has the effect of silencing the world. Even the wind goes quiet. All is still. You sense, rather than see, the trees pressing in against you, closing ranks. The dense, murky smells of moss and earth overwhelm your senses. In the stillness, a single, repetitive sound emerges: your own heartbeat. These woods fill you with dread and foreboding.</p>

  <p>A lonely Watchtower sits at the edge of the Great Forest. You can just barely make out the sound of running water somewhere far beyond it - lost in those trees is the fabled river East Chain. And still further beyond that, the sorcerous Circle of Illusion, your destination. The Au’vanwa shun the Forest. The Marinese fear it. And the Lundisians thrive on its aura of mystery.</p>

  <p>Oarsrest sits in the shadow of an enormous mountain, Seawatch. Its high smooth cliffs give the impression of an enormous shield. Compared to Redwater, this is a sprawling metropolis. It lacks the great walls or high stone towers of Redwater, but more than makes up for it in the huge number of homes, shipyards and forges. Its harbor stretches as far as you can see before the coastline curves around towards the north. Everywhere, people are furiously at work in some trade or commerce.</p>

The scents and sounds of the sea mingle gently with those of the market, the smoke of the forges. Downstairs, you can hear the servants setting out your breakfast. You are guests of the Good Duke Geoffrey, whose life you recently saved, and into whose services you now find yourself bound. All good things must come to an end. Today is the date of your agreed-upon departure.</p>

  <p>A hush falls over the party-goers. A loud pop and fading whine soars up into the midnight sky. After a moment of silence there is a crackle and a series of multicolored explosions light up the garden, casting long shadows against the Duke’s Estate. Red, blue, green and yellow fires in the shapes of flowers, shooting stars and glittering suns are painted across the sky as more and more fireworks are launched into the air. The crowd gasps and applauds. For many, it is the first time in their lives that they have seen such a display. A moment later, the screaming begins.</p>

  <p>You descend forty feet down the old well, noting the intricate carvings along its edges, matching them to the Lighthouse at the tip of the peninsula Marinal’s Call. At its base is a staircase spiraling even further into the depths. The hall to the south is caved in, but to the north you are met with high, stained-glass windows. As you continue your exploration, the ceiling opens up into a high dome. Reflected in the glass, in frescoes, in statues carved into columns, the cathedral’s repeating motif is that of a serenely smiling sun and feathered wings.</p>

A guard tower rises from the water at the end of a stone jetty. In the center of town, an open square appears crowded around a large tavern, smoke pouring from its many high chimneys. The smell of smoked meats and fish fill the air. Closer to the city gate, you can hear the cries of men at work on the walls, and at the forges.</p>

Every part of you hurts, you are sore as if beaten. Your clothes and belongings are damp and filled with sand. You were chewed up and spit out by the Ocean herself. Every breath you take is a miracle. Distant memories of the voyage return to you, as if from another life. You can still hear an echo of the voices of sailors, shouting orders, fearfully.</p>

You were hired to protect The Last Word and its cargo by a group of Filian Wizards. It is day ten.</p>
