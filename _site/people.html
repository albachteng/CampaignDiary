            <image class="character" src="resources/images/Beldryn.jpg"></image>
        </div>
        <p>Beldryn changed his last name to Bronzeheart after joining the Bronze Bank 
            of Filia to hide his shame: he was ousted from the Iron Halls for a foolhardy 
            ploy in the War of the Golden Mountains. Seeking to force a quick end to the war, 
            he gambled with the lives of an entire battalion under his command throwing them 
            in full force against the advancing enemy, but was outsmarted by the Goblins of 
            the nearby Iron Hills. Almost none survived the battle, although the dwarves did 
            eventually win the war. His true name is Beldryn Runeguard, making him the heir 
            to a long line of decorated Kingsguard.  </p>

            <image class="character" src="resources/images/Lem.jpeg"></image>
        </div>
        <p>Lem to his companions, this sneaky goblin hails from the Iron Hills. He exhibits an insatiable curiosity and fondness for tinkering with potions and equipment - the more explosive, the better. Sly and perceptive, he gets the party out of trouble almost as quick as he can get them into trouble. The rogue has proven himself particularly convincing and charming when it comes to sniffing out work for the party, and talking his way out of difficult situations, often with an assumed dialect.</p>

            <image class="character" src="resources/images/Rawson.jpg"></image>
        </div>
        <p>Rawson Titanwound's background, before joining the mercenaries of the Bronze Vault of Filia, was as a hunter of beasts. He took a particular speciality in lycanthropy, and therefore styles himself as a Werewolf Hunter. His skills with beasts have already helped the party out of dire situations, as it turns out there are beasts aplenty in Mondial. Generally seeing himself as the voice of reason in the party, his contributions have more often than not gently nudged the party down a safer path. </p>

            <image class="character" src="resources/images/Isho.jpg"></image>
        </div>
        <p>Isho hails from the sands beyond the Golden Hills, making him a foreigner among foreigners in the party. A member of a nomadic tribe, he was raised as a Sun Warrior, like his father before him and his grandmother before that. He carries with him a small amount of desert sands, which serves as an oracle for ritual divination, and wields the distinctive yari swordspear of his people. Isho is a stalwart warrior, often rushing to the front of the group to serve as the party's bulwark. He speaks Common slowly and carefully, unfamiliar as he is with the language, and he often finds the lifestyle of city dwellers confusing, but his strong moral character makes him the heart and conscience of the party.</p>

            <image class="character" src="resources/images/Minotaur.jpeg"></image>
        </div>
        <p>The party knew little of his kind before arriving in Mondial, but Ulrach of the Au'vanwa quickly demonstrated that his kind are trustworthy, serious and capable warriors. His tribe instilled in him a powerful distrust of arcane artifacts and The Art, but with Chain's End closed and his tribe desperate for resources, he agrees to join the adventurers to investigate the practices of Lundis and The Circle of Illusion within the forests he was taught to avoid for the good of his tribe.</p>

            <image class="character" src="resources/images/AuVanwa Elf.jpg"></image>
        </div>
        <p>The generous and kindhearted leader of a caravan of Au'vanwa, and the
            first living soul our party encountered in Mondial. The caravan he leads
            was seeking work as mercenaries in Chain's End, but were turned away due 
            to an unknown plague. The nomadic elf shared his fire, his wine, as well 
            as his knowledge of the Artifacts and The War of the Lights. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Duke Geoffrey Belmont</h2>
    <p>The jovial and rotund Duke of Redwater, although he spends more time in Chain's End dealing with the King and parliament. Still, the people of Redwater love him and call him "The Good Duke Geoffrey, Blessing of the Four Winds upon him!" Shortly after meeting the party (and imprisoning them on the word of his Steward, Anders) Geoffrey was the target of an assassination attempt by unknown forces. Subsequently, he revealed to his adventurous saviors that he was once a member of the Knights of Marina, a clandestine group of warriors in service of the King. Now he has another job for the adventurers: find out who tried to have him killed, and why. And so the party sets off for Lundis and the Great Forest.</p>
    <h2>Anders</h2>
    <p>The cold and calculating Steward of Redwater. He serves at the pleasure of
        the Good Duke Geoffrey, brother to the King. Anders hired the party to find
        and eliminate those responsible for attacks on trade caravans along the East
        Road towards Balnying. Upon their return, he insists that the mercenaries lie
        about the cause of the attacks, blaming everything on Disparia. When the party hesitated,
        he had them imprisoned. It quickly becomes apparent that he is not who he seems, as the party 
        learns of his involvement in a plot to assassinate the Duke Geoffrey and place blame on 
        Disparians. Before the party could learn more about his motives, they found him dead in the very same cell in which he had
        imprisoned them. 
    </p>
    <h2>Ora</h2>
    <p>Ora was a mage of The Circle of Illusion, but she ran away for unknown reasons. 
        She describes life in The Circles as dangerous and oppressive, and she has deep
        scars to prove it. She aided the party in their search for the creatures attacking
        Redwater's caravans before vanishing from her home.
