    <div class="container">
        <image class="character" src="/assets/images/Beldryn.jpg"></image>
        <p><p>Beldryn changed his last name to Bronzeheart after joining the Bronze Bank of Filia to hide his shame: he was ousted from the Iron Halls for a foolhardy ploy in the War of the Golden Mountains. Seeking to force a quick end to the war, he gambled with the lives of an entire battalion under his command throwing them in full force against the advancing enemy, but was outsmarted by the Goblins of the nearby Iron Hills. Almost none survived the battle, although the dwarves did eventually win the war. His true name is Beldryn Runeguard, making him the heir to a long line of decorated Kingsguard.<br /><br />Beldryn died defending <em>The Last Word</em> and its crew, wielding the <em>Moonlight Greatsword</em> against a mighty kraken with a woman’s face.</p>

    <div class="container">
        <image class="character" src="/assets/images/assassin.jpg"></image>
        <p><p>When the party first found him, he was part of a band of mercenaries killing adventurers and stealing any magical items they could find. But Hubert quickly made a deal with them in exchange for his life and he has more than kept his word. Raised in Lundis as an assassin for the Church, his first loyalty is to his god Malorn. With the fall of Lundis to Disparian invasion, Hubert has stood by his new companions longer than he originally anticipated. And with his previously destroyed legs now miraculously healed, he seems bent on re-establishing the Church of Malorn and some other grim task seemingly revealed to him in prayer: to kill Einan the Black, the Mage-Prince of Disparia.</p>
</p>

    <h2><a target="_blank" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/27859882/kKKN7J">Isho-Genni Hassada</a></h2>
    <div class="container">
        <image class="character" src="/assets/images/Isho.jpg"></image>
        <p><p>Isho hails from the sands beyond the Golden Hills, making him a foreigner among foreigners in the party. A member of a nomadic tribe, he was raised as a Sun Warrior, like his father before him and his grandmother before that. He carries with him a small amount of desert sands, which serves as an oracle for ritual divination, and wields the distinctive yari swordspear of his people. Isho is a stalwart warrior, often rushing to the front of the group to serve as the party’s bulwark. He speaks Common slowly and carefully, unfamiliar as he is with the language, and he often finds the lifestyle of city dwellers confusing, but his strong moral character makes him the heart and conscience of the party.</p>
</p>

    <div class="container">
        <image class="character" src="/assets/images/Lem.jpeg"></image>
        <p><p>Lem to his companions, this sneaky goblin hails from the Iron Hills. He exhibits an insatiable curiosity and fondness for tinkering with potions and equipment - the more explosive, the better. Sly and perceptive, he gets the party out of trouble almost as quick as he can get them into trouble. The rogue has proven himself particularly convincing and charming when it comes to sniffing out work for the party, and talking his way out of difficult situations, often with an assumed dialect.</p>
</p>

    <h2><a target="_blank" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/28540226/mhScaz">Rawson Titanwound</a></h2>
    <div class="container">
        <image class="character" src="/assets/images/Rawson.jpg"></image>
        <p><p>Rawson Titanwound’s background, before joining the mercenaries of the Bronze Vault of Filia, was as a hunter of beasts. He took a particular speciality in lycanthropy, and therefore styles himself as a Werewolf Hunter. His skills with beasts have already helped the party out of dire situations, as it turns out there are beasts aplenty in Mondial. Generally seeing himself as the voice of reason in the party, his contributions have more often than not gently nudged the party down a safer path.</p>
</p>

    <div class="container">
        <image class="character" src="/assets/images/Minotaur.jpeg"></image>
        <p><p>The party knew little of his kind before arriving in Mondial, but Ulrach of the Au’vanwa quickly demonstrated that his kind are trustworthy, serious and capable warriors. His tribe instilled in him a powerful distrust of arcane artifacts and The Art, but with Chain’s End closed and his tribe desperate for resources, he agrees to join the adventurers to investigate the practices of Lundis and The Circle of Illusion within the forests he was taught to avoid for the good of his tribe.</p>

    <div class="npc Marina hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Ada Dalton</h2></div>
        <div class="npc-content"><p>The Knights are a clandestine group, often disguised as beggars or servants, more assassins and spies than proper Knights. In times past, the Knights supplemented their skill at arms with magic, but those arts are lost to the modern Knight. Their weapons and attire are designed to hide their status and equipment rather than display it.
<br /><br />
When the players met Ada, she was serving Duke Geoffrey undercover as a “tutor” to the Lady Dauphine, his daughter. She is regularly charged with equipping and debriefing the adventurers in their contract work with Marina. 
<br /><br />
It appears her name was once Abigail, however, since the Knight Simon, stationed in Lundis, asked the party to deliver to “Abigail” a locket bearing her image. She accepted the item without a word from Lem.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="npc Lundis hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Alva</h2></div>
        <div class="npc-content"><p>A Pygmie that the party allied with briefly during their assault on White Tower. Alva went to the dungeons below the Grand Cathedral with the party to find some friends trapped there. She abandoned the party when Lem attempted to extort money out of her in exchange for saving her allies. 
<br /><br />
Alva tracked the party to Marina after her friend succumbed to the injuries sustained at the hands of the Church. In the disguise of Vala, claiming to be a Pygmy mage that could heal Ulrach and Hubert, she followed the party beneath the city. Her treachery earned her death in the dungeons of Marina.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="npc Marina hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Anders</h2></div>
        <div class="npc-content"><p>The cold and calculating Steward of Redwater. Anders hired the party to find and eliminate those responsible for attacks on trade caravans along the East Road towards Balnying. Upon their return, he insists that the mercenaries lie about the cause of the attacks, blaming everything on Disparia. When the party hesitated, he had them imprisoned. 
<br /><br /> 
The party learned of his involvement in a plot to assassinate the Duke Geoffrey and place blame on Disparians. They found him dead in the very same cell in which he had imprisoned them. A strange satyr-like creature was standing over him, dressed in green and wiping the blood from his hands.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="npc Marina hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>King Balin</h2></div>
        <div class="npc-content"><p>Widely believed to be a drunk and a fool, the party was granted an audience with the king. It did not go well, but at Geoffrey’s urging, Balin agreed to hire the party for another mission. Balin is a bear of a man, catatonically alcoholic and mostly appears indifferent to matters of state. Nevertheless, he is clearly eager for a fight with Disparia, and considers their nation the greatest threat to Marinese wellfare.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="npc Marina hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Lady Dauphine</h2></div>
        <div class="npc-content"><p>Geoffrey’s daughter is mostly bedridden due to a strange disease of the mind. She was found wandering near the forests and ever since she has spoken primarily in riddles, rhymes and fairy tales. She has grown incredibly fond of Ulrach, who seems to share in her madness, and in the great difficulty they both have in talking about it.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="npc Marina hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Captain Curly Davenport</h2></div>
        <div class="npc-content"><p>Captain of <em>The Gin Mule</em>, a former pirate conscripted into service for the king. An older man, Davenport often tells tales of his time living through the events of The War of Bays, in which Disparia invaded what was once Marinese lands near The Rifts. Despite his age, he managed to survive being thrown overboard during an attack by the kraken - in no small part due to the party’s quick thinking and persistence.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="npc DeepRoads hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Dundarrin</h2></div>
        <div class="npc-content"><p>A dwarf of Cloudstone, one of the few the party has ever encountered. He was a member of the Deep Miner’s Guild, a band of mercenaries worth their weight in gold.
<br /><br />
At first, he was an ally to the party, aiding in the assault on White Tower. When the battle was won, he turned on the party, helping Makar to assassinate the Queen of Lundis and welcoming the approaching Disparian army - and their dragons. All part of the plan, according to him.
<br /><br />
His fate is unknown.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="npc Marina hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Eileen, the Crow</h2></div>
        <div class="npc-content"><p>A goblin with a mechanical arm and a plague-mask that the party found in the dungeons of Marina while clearing it of the infected. She seems to have voluntarily taken on the task of clearing the dungeons herself and setting traps to protect the survivors at the base of the stairs.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="npc TheWeald hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Einan the Black</h2></div>
        <div class="npc-content"><p>A mysteroius figure, long believed to have been killed in a cataclysmic event known as “The Tragedy of Einan” in songs. He was a prince of Disparia who established the greatest school of magic of his time: The Circle of Evocation.
<br /><br />
Whatever it was he was studying, it resulted in a conflagration that burn the circle and its towers to ash. It was because of this act that magic was outlawed in the human kingdoms.
<br /><br />
Lem freed him from his Mirror to help them kill a trio of adult dragons that Disparia had unleashed on White Tower. His current whereabouts are unknown.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="npc TheWeald hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>The Gentleman</h2></div>
        <div class="npc-content"><p>The Gentleman is a member of an unknown fey race that predates Malorn. He claims to be “The First Lieutenant and Spy of the Raven King,” but much of what he says sounds like pure madness. He seems to think of the party, especially Ulrach, as his pets. 
<br /><br />
The Gentleman is a powerful creature. Normally prim and elegantly dressed, the party has seen him lose his mind to frenzy, sprouting scales and feathered wings and breathing fire as some form of black-feathered dragon. But the Gentleman cannot seem to break through the veil separating The Weald and Mondial without help - help that that party refuses to give. 
<br /><br />
He has also implied that he is responsible for the Lady Dauphine’s madness.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="npc Marina hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Duke Geoffrey</h2></div>
        <div class="npc-content"><p>The jovial and rotund Duke of Redwater, although he spends more time in Chain’s End dealing with the King and parliament. Still, the people of Redwater love him and call him “The Good Duke Geoffrey, Blessing of the Four Winds upon him!” Shortly after meeting the party Geoffrey was the target of an assassination attempt by unknown forces. Subsequently, he revealed to his adventurous saviors that he was once a member of the Knights of Marina, a clandestine group of warriors in service of the King. 
<br /><br />
He has since hired the adventurers several times and has become their primary benefactor. There is a sadness to him for all the laughter and friendliness - for his daughter, the Lady Dauphine, is desperately ill and he cannot help her.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="npc Marina hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Tzitzik, "Hanford Paddle"</h2></div>
        <div class="npc-content"><p>The chief engineer of <em>The Gin Mule</em>, a pirate ship conscripted into service for Marina. He was caught scratching strange signs into the side of the ship and was apprehended by the party. When confronted on his scheming, the goblin gave up little, except to say that he had “saved everyone” and that “Lucius awakens.” Lem spent a great deal of time trying to understand the Water Elemental-powered engine that he created for the ship, indicating that Tzitzik was an artificer of no small skill. He died during the party’s search of the abandoned ship, <em>The Last Word</em>.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="npc Marina hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Hans, "Cauliflower Ear"</h2></div>
        <div class="npc-content"><p>A ruffian that Ulrach once fought in a bar in Redwater, Hans appears to have moved up in life. When Ulrach saw him last, he expressed remorse for his prior unkindness. He is now in service to Duke Geoffrey, a man famous for offering second chances - perhaps to his detriment.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="npc Lundis hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Kolat</h2></div>
        <div class="npc-content"><p>Last mage to remain at his post at the Circle of Illusion, Kolat sought to unlock the secrets of The Mirror of Einan. He seemed to be mad when the party found him, and believed The Gentleman to be his “fairy servant.” 
<br /><br />
The party defeated him narrowly, and when Kolat failed to deliver on his promise to use the power of the Mirror, The Gentleman killed him.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="npc Marina hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Captain Heywood Loom</h2></div>
        <div class="npc-content"><p>Loom was promoted before the adventurer’s very eyes after the attempt on Geoffrey’s life. He defended the Duke successfully while the party dealt with the mimic’s assault. 
<br /><br />
Since then, Loom has been one of Geoffrey’s most trusted soldiers, and regularly gives the adventurers debriefings.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="npc Disparia hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Hunter Makar</h2></div>
        <div class="npc-content"><p>A Hunter of Disparia, Makar was one of the inner circle of <em>His Eye</em>, a group claiming to be working towards a populist uprising in White Tower against the Church of Malorn. He fought alongside the adventurers and even offered them work with Disparia. 
<br /><br />
Ultimately, his friendship was a front. He and Dundarrin sought to obliterate Lundis, not liberate it. Makar killed the adolescent Queen of Lundis with his final breath.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="npc Lundis hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Queen Malise Rutvyen</h2></div>
        <div class="npc-content"><p>The teenage Queen of Lundis was a figurehead for her entire reign. Pontiff Sulyvahn claimed that she had given him control over White Tower as Protector, but she was, in truth, a prisoner in her own home. 
<br /><br />
Queen Malise was killed by the Hunter Makar of Disparia as part of the Disparian plot to wipe Lundis off the map. With her, the last of the royal line - and the blood of Malorn - is exterminated.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="npc Lundis hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Scholar Melwyn</h2></div>
        <div class="npc-content"><p>A rogue Scholar of the School of Talen, Melwyn stole from the party and fled to Oarsrest. There he impersonated members of the party and made them enemies among the local crime lords, ultimately impersonating the kingpin of the town’s criminal elements. 
<br /><br />
His luck ran out. The party ended his life in a hidden cove before they fled the city.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="npc Marina hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Merryn</h2></div>
        <div class="npc-content"><p>The wheelchair-bound former Lundisian assassin now lives a quiet life undercover as a Knight of Marina. His last known post was at North Tower on the edge of the Great Forest, watching the comings and goings of the brave and foolhardy alike.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="npc DeepRoads hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Myca</h2></div>
        <div class="npc-content"><p>The Myconid Containment Apparatus are a collection of spores that ostensibly were set to grow at the entrances to the Deep Roads long ago. They are apparently a modified version of the infection spores that drive living creatures mad. MYCA’s primary function is to prevent infected individuals from exiting the underground. 
<br /><br />
The party left Myca in Chain’s End, capital of Marina, to prevent further outbreak of the plague there.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="npc Lundis hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Inquisitor Narissa</h2></div>
        <div class="npc-content"><p>Long a tormentor to Hubert as he came up in his training as a Church Assassin, Narissa was promoted in his absence to Inquisitor, and was even rumored to be the heir apparent to newly appointed High Inquisitor Noska. Narissa was a cold, calculating and viciously cruel person, and she reserved her worst for Hubert. She openly questioned Hubert’s right to be a member of the Church hierarchy, wealdscum that he is, and promised to eradicate the non-human elements from the Church when she inevitably ascended to Noska’s position. 
<br /><br />
The adventurers killed Narissa during their escape from the Catacombs and the fall of White Tower.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="npc Lundis hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>High Inquisitor Noska</h2></div>
        <div class="npc-content"><p>Noted for perhaps the shortest and most catastrophic tenure as High Inquisitor - what was previously the highest-rank in the Church of Lundis - High Inquisitor Noska took over the position when Sulyvahn the Tyrant proclaimed himself Pontiff and usurped the rightful queen, Malise. He was noted for his calm demeanor and his absolute trust in Sulyvahn. He fully endorsed the Church’s political takeover of Lundis, and spoke fondly of “the project”, which remains a mystery to the adventurers. 
<br /><br />
High Inquisitor Noska was taken hostage in the medical theater in the Catacombs during Hubert’s attempt to free Ulrach. His life ended unceremoniously, when Hubert cut his throat to face Pontiff Sulyvahn himself.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="npc Marina hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Ora</h2></div>
        <div class="npc-content"><p>Ora was a mage of The Circle of Illusion, but she ran away for unknown reasons. She describes life in The Circles as dangerous and oppressive, and she has deep scars to prove it. She aided the party in their search for the creatures attacking Redwater’s caravans before vanishing from her home.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="npc DeepRoads hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Rogga</h2></div>
        <div class="npc-content"><p>This mysterious and unkempt dwarf has popped up along the party’s path through Mondial too many times for it to be a coincidence. He seems to be much more powerful than he lets on, exhibiting control over stone, earth and lightning. He speaks in riddles, contradicts himself, and has even unceremoniously pushed Lem into a fiery pit. He has warned the party that he is “a bad friend, and a very good enemy.”</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="npc Lundis hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Pontiff Sulyvahn</h2></div>
        <div class="npc-content"><p>Sulyvahn, previously High Inquisitor of the Church of Malorn, claimed to be over a thousand years old when he captured Hubert and Ulrach. While he revealed little of substance, he was adamant that his choice to overthrow the Queen of Lundis was for the good of its people - that he would drag the race of men kicking and screaming into the next age whether they liked it or not. 
<br /><br />
The party killed Sulyvahn during the storming of White Tower. His final words were: “Nathaniel… do not let them tell you who you are.”</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="npc Disparia hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Talpa Adamina</h2></div>
        <div class="npc-content"><p>The generous leader of a caravan of Au’vanwa, and the first living soul our party encountered in Mondial. The caravan he leads was seeking work as mercenaries in Chain’s End, but were turned away due to an unknown plague. The nomadic elf shared his fire, his wine, as well as his knowledge of the Artifacts and The War of the Lights.
<br /><br />
Talpa’s name was found etched into a bookcase in the towers of the Circle of Illusion. Yet the Au’vanwa are said to shun the Great Forest. His current whereabouts are unknown.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="npc Lundis hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Scholar Urgrey</h2></div>
        <div class="npc-content"><p>His origins are unknown to the party, but he was apparently a Scholar of some rank. The title typically is reserved for one learned in artificery and archaeology, and is often associated with the School of Talen. Scholar Urgrey wore a telescopic monocle and his primary function in the Catacombs of White Tower was to remove brain fluid from humanoid subjects - a practice which he revealed was necessary for the creation of Communion, the Church’s antidote to the frenzied madness caused by the use of certain magical items.

Many died in the fall of White Tower, but Scholar Urgrey’s fate remains unknown.</p>
