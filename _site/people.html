    <div class="container">
        <image class="character" src="./assets/images/Beldryn.jpg"></image>
        <p><p>Beldryn changed his last name to Bronzeheart after joining the Bronze Bank of Filia to hide his shame: he was ousted from the Iron Halls for a foolhardy ploy in the War of the Golden Mountains. Seeking to force a quick end to the war, he gambled with the lives of an entire battalion under his command throwing them in full force against the advancing enemy, but was outsmarted by the Goblins of the nearby Iron Hills. Almost none survived the battle, although the dwarves did eventually win the war. His true name is Beldryn Runeguard, making him the heir to a long line of decorated Kingsguard.<br /><br />Beldryn died defending <em>The Last Word</em> and its crew, wielding the <em>Moonlight Greatsword</em> against a mighty kraken with a woman’s face.</p>
</p>

    <h2><a target="_blank" href="/assets/sheets/Hubert.pdf">Hubert</a></h2>
    <div class="container">
        <image class="character" src="./assets/images/assassin.jpg"></image>
        <p><p>When the party first found him, he was part of a band of mercenaries killing adventurers and stealing any magical items they could find. But Hubert quickly made a deal with them in exchange for his life and he has more than kept his word. Raised in Lundis as an assassin for the Church, his first loyalty is to his god Malorn. With the fall of Lundis to Disparian invasion, Hubert has stood by his new companions longer than he originally anticipated. And with his previously destroyed legs now miraculously healed, he seems bent on re-establishing the Church of Malorn and some other grim task seemingly revealed to him in prayer: to kill Einan the Black, the Mage-Prince of Disparia.</p>
</p>
    </div>

    <h2><a target="_blank" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/27859882/kKKN7J">Isho-Genni Hassada</a></h2>
    <div class="container">
        <image class="character" src="./assets/images/Isho.jpg"></image>
        <p><p>Isho hails from the sands beyond the Golden Hills, making him a foreigner among foreigners in the party. A member of a nomadic tribe, he was raised as a Sun Warrior, like his father before him and his grandmother before that. He carries with him a small amount of desert sands, which serves as an oracle for ritual divination, and wields the distinctive yari swordspear of his people. Isho is a stalwart warrior, often rushing to the front of the group to serve as the party’s bulwark. He speaks Common slowly and carefully, unfamiliar as he is with the language, and he often finds the lifestyle of city dwellers confusing, but his strong moral character makes him the heart and conscience of the party.</p>
</p>
    </div>

    <h2><a target="_blank" href="/assets/sheets/Lemullius%20von%20Litwick%20Character%20Sheet.pdf">Lemullius von Litwick</a></h2>
    <div class="container">
        <image class="character" src="./assets/images/Lem.jpeg"></image>
        <p><p>Lem to his companions, this sneaky goblin hails from the Iron Hills. He exhibits an insatiable curiosity and fondness for tinkering with potions and equipment - the more explosive, the better. Sly and perceptive, he gets the party out of trouble almost as quick as he can get them into trouble. The rogue has proven himself particularly convincing and charming when it comes to sniffing out work for the party, and talking his way out of difficult situations, often with an assumed dialect.</p>
</p>
    </div>

    <h2><a target="_blank" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/28540226/mhScaz">Rawson Titanwound</a></h2>
    <div class="container">
        <image class="character" src="./assets/images/Rawson.jpg"></image>
        <p><p>Rawson Titanwound’s background, before joining the mercenaries of the Bronze Vault of Filia, was as a hunter of beasts. He took a particular speciality in lycanthropy, and therefore styles himself as a Werewolf Hunter. His skills with beasts have already helped the party out of dire situations, as it turns out there are beasts aplenty in Mondial. Generally seeing himself as the voice of reason in the party, his contributions have more often than not gently nudged the party down a safer path.</p>
</p>
    </div>

    <h2><a target="_blank" href="/assets/sheets/Ulrach%20Thyrmyr.pdf">Ulrach Thyrmyr</a></h2>
    <div class="container">
        <image class="character" src="./assets/images/Minotaur.jpeg"></image>
        <p><p>The party knew little of his kind before arriving in Mondial, but Ulrach of the Au’vanwa quickly demonstrated that his kind are trustworthy, serious and capable warriors. His tribe instilled in him a powerful distrust of arcane artifacts and The Art, but with Chain’s End closed and his tribe desperate for resources, he agrees to join the adventurers to investigate the practices of Lundis and The Circle of Illusion within the forests he was taught to avoid for the good of his tribe.</p>

<h2 class="selection"></h2>

    
   
    <div class="container npc Marina hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Ada Dalton</h2></div>
        <div><p>The Knights are a clandestine group, often disguised as beggars or servants, more assassins and spies than proper Knights. In times past, the Knights supplemented their skill at arms with magic, but those arts are lost to the modern Knight. Their weapons and attire are designed to hide their status and equipment rather than display it.<br /><br />When the players met Ada, she was serving Duke Geoffrey undercover as a “tutor” to the Lady Dauphine, his daughter. She is regularly charged with equipping and debriefing the adventurers in their contract work with Marina. 
<br /><br />
It appears her name was once Abigail, however, since the Knight Simon, stationed in Lundis, asked the party to deliver to “Abigail” a locket bearing her image. She accepted the item without a word from Lem.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="container npc Lundis hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Alva</h2></div>
        <div><p>A Pygmie that the party befriended briefly during their assault on White Tower. Alva went to the dungeons below the Grand Cathedral with the party to find some friends trapped there. <br /><br /> She turned on the party later on, when Lem attempted to extort money out of her in exchange for saving her allies.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="container npc Marina hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Anders</h2></div>
        <div><p>The cold and calculating Steward of Redwater. Anders hired the party to find and eliminate those responsible for attacks on trade caravans along the East Road towards Balnying. Upon their return, he insists that the mercenaries lie about the cause of the attacks, blaming everything on Disparia. When the party hesitated, he had them imprisoned. 
<br /><br /> 
The party learned of his involvement in a plot to assassinate the Duke Geoffrey and place blame on Disparians. They found him dead in the very same cell in which he had imprisoned them. A strange satyr-like creature was standing over him, dressed in green and wiping the blood from his hands.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="container npc Marina hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>King Balin</h2></div>
        <div><p>Widely believed to be a drunk and a fool, the party was granted an audience with the king. It did not go well, but at Geoffrey’s urging, Balin agreed to hire the party for another mission.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="container npc Marina hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Lady Dauphine</h2></div>
        <div><p>Geoffrey’s daughter is mostly bedridden due to a strange disease of the mind. She was found wandering near the forests and ever since she has spoken primarily in riddles, rhymes and fairy tales.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="container npc DeepRoads hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Dundarrin</h2></div>
        <div><p>A dwarf of Cloudstone, one of the few the party has ever encountered. He was a member of the Deep Miner’s Guild, a band of mercenaries worth their weight in gold. 
<br /><br />
At first, he was an ally to the party, aiding in the assault on White Tower. When the battle was won, he turned on the party, helping Makar to assassinate the Queen of Lundis and welcoming the approaching Disparian army - and their dragons. All part of the plan, according to him. 
<br /><br />
His fate is unknown.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="container npc TheWeald hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Einan the Black</h2></div>
        <div><p>A mysteroius figure, long believed to have been killed in a cataclysmic event known as “The Tragedy of Einan” in songs. He was a prince of Disparia who established the greatest school of magic of his time: The Circle of Evocation. 
<br /><br />
Whatever it was he was studying, it resulted in a conflagration that burn the circle and its towers to ash. It was because of this act that magic was nearly outlawed in the human kingdoms. 
<br /><br />
Lem freed him from his Mirror to help them kill a trio of adult dragons that Disparia had unleashed on White Tower. His current whereabouts are unknown.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="container npc TheWeald hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>The Gentleman</h2></div>
        <div><p>The Gentleman is a member of an unknown fae race that predates Malorn. He claims to be “The First Lieutenant and Spy of the Raven King,” but much of what he says sounds like pure madness. He seems to think of the party, especially Ulrach, as his pets. 
<br /><br />
The Gentleman is a powerful creature. Normally prim and elegantly dressed, the party has seen him lose his mind to frenzy, sprouting scaled and feathered wings and breathing fire as some form of feathered dragon. But the Gentleman cannot seem to break through the veil separating The Weald and Mondial without help - help that that party refuses to give. 
<br /><br />
He has also implied that he is responsible for the Lady Dauphine’s madness.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="container npc Marina hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Duke Geoffrey</h2></div>
        <div><p>The jovial and rotund Duke of Redwater, although he spends more time in Chain’s End dealing with the King and parliament. Still, the people of Redwater love him and call him “The Good Duke Geoffrey, Blessing of the Four Winds upon him!” Shortly after meeting the party Geoffrey was the target of an assassination attempt by unknown forces. Subsequently, he revealed to his adventurous saviors that he was once a member of the Knights of Marina, a clandestine group of warriors in service of the King. 
<br /><br />
He has since hired the adventurers several times and has become their primary benefactor. There is a sadness to him for all the laughter and friendliness - for his daughter, the Lady Dauphine, is desperately ill and he cannot save her.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="container npc Lundis hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Kolat</h2></div>
        <div><p>Last mage to remain at the Circle of Illusion, Kolat sought to unlock the secrets of The Mirror of Einan. He seemed to be mad when the party found him, and believed The Gentleman to be his “fairy servant.” 
<br /><br />
When Kolat failed to deliver on his promise to use the power of the Mirror, The Gentleman killed him.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="container npc Marina hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Captain Heywood Loom</h2></div>
        <div><p>Loom was promoted before the adventurer’s very eyes after the attempt on Geoffrey’s life. He defended the Duke successfully while the party dealt with the mimic’s assault. 
<br /><br />
Since then, Loom has been one of Geoffrey’s most trusted soldiers, and regularly gives the adventurers debriefings.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="container npc Disparia hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Hunter Makar</h2></div>
        <div><p>A Hunter of Disparia, Makar was one of the inner circle of <em>His Eye</em>, a group claiming to be working towards a populist uprising in White Tower against the Church of Malorn. He fought alongside the adventurers and even offered them work with Disparia. 
<br /><br />
Ultimately, his friendship was a front. Him and Dundarrin sought to obliterate Lundis, not liberate it. Makar killed the adolescent Queen of Lundis with his final breath.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="container npc Lundis hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Queen Malise Rutvyen</h2></div>
        <div><p>The teenage Queen of Lundis was more of a figurehead for her entire reign. Pontiff Sulyvahn claimed that she had given him control over White Tower as Protector, but she was, in truth, a prisoner in her own home. 
<br /><br />
Queen Malise was killed by the Hunter Makar of Disparia as part of the Disparian plot to wipe Lundis off the map. With her, the last of the royal line is exterminated.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="container npc Lundis hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Scholar Melwyn</h2></div>
        <div><p>A rogue Scholar of the School of Talen, Melwyn stole from the party and fled to Oarsrest. There he impersonated members of the party and made them enemies among the local crime lords, ultimately impersonating the kingpin of the town’s criminal elements. 
<br /><br />
His luck ran out and the party ended his life before fleeing the city.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="container npc Marina hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Merryn</h2></div>
        <div><p>The wheelchair-bound former Lundisian assassin now lives a quiet life undercover as a Knight of Marina. His last known post was at North Tower on the edge of the Great Forest, watching the comings and goings of the brave and foolhardy alike.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="container npc DeepRoads hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>MYCA</h2></div>
        <div><p>The Myconid Containment Apparatus is a collection of spores that ostensibly were set to grow at the entrances to the Deep Roads long ago. They are apparently a modified version of the infection spores that drive living creatures mad. MYCA’s primary function is to prevent infected individuals from exiting the underground. 
<br /><br />
The party left Myca in Chain’s End, capital of Marina, to prevent further outbreak of the plague there.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="container npc Marina hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Ora</h2></div>
        <div><p>Ora was a mage of The Circle of Illusion, but she ran away for unknown reasons. She describes life in The Circles as dangerous and oppressive, and she has deep scars to prove it. She aided the party in their search for the creatures attacking Redwater’s caravans before vanishing from her home.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="container npc DeepRoads hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Rogga</h2></div>
        <div><p>This mysterious and unkempt dwarf has popped up along the party’s path through Mondial too many times for it to be a coincidence. He seems to be much more powerful than he let on, seemingly capable of control over stone, earth and lightning. He speaks in riddles, contradicts himself, and has even unceremoniously pushed Lem into a fiery pit. He has warned the party that he is “a bad friend, and a very good enemy.”
<br /><br />
The last time the party saw him, he seemed to be able to attack The Gentleman through the veil that separates The Weald from Mondial.</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="container npc Lundis hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Pontiff Sulyvahn</h2></div>
        <div><p>Sulyvahn, previously High Inquisitor of the Church of Malorn, claimed to be over a thousand years old when he captured Hubert and Ulrach. While he revealed little of substance, he was adamant that his choice to overthrow the Queen of Lundis was for the good of its people - that he would drag the race of men kicking and screaming into the next age whether they liked it or not. 
<br /><br />
The party killed Sulyvahn during the storming of White Tower. His final words were: “Nathaniel - do not let them tell you who you are.”</p>
</div>
    </div>


   
    <div class="container npc Disparia hide">
        <div class="name"><h2>Talpa Adamina</h2></div>
        <div><p>The generous leader of a caravan of Au’vanwa, and the first living soul our party encountered in Mondial. The caravan he leads was seeking work as mercenaries in Chain’s End, but were turned away due to an unknown plague. The nomadic elf shared his fire, his wine, as well as his knowledge of the Artifacts and The War of the Lights.
<br /><br />
Talpa’s name was found etched into a bookcase in the towers of the Circle of Illusion. But the Au’vanwa are said to shun the Great Forest. His current whereabouts are unknown.</p>
