        </div>
        <p>
            <p>Beldryn changed his last name to Bronzeheart after joining the Bronze Bank of Filia to hide his shame: he was ousted from the Iron Halls for a foolhardy ploy in the War of the Golden Mountains. Seeking to force a quick end to the war, he gambled with the lives of an entire battalion under his command throwing them in full force against the advancing enemy, but was outsmarted by the Goblins of the nearby Iron Hills. Almost none survived the battle, although the dwarves did eventually win the war. His true name is Beldryn Runeguard, making him the heir to a long line of decorated Kingsguard.</p>

<p>Beldryn died defending <em>The Last Word</em> and its crew, wielding the <em>Moonlight Greatsword</em> against a mighty kraken with a woman’s face.</p>

        </div>
        <p>
            <p>When the party first found him, he was part of a band of mercenaries killing adventurers and stealing any magical items they could find. But Hubert quickly made a deal with them in exchange for his life and he has more than kept his word. Raised in Lundis as an assassin for the Church, his first loyalty is to his god Malorn. With the fall of Lundis to Disparian invasion, Hubert has stood by his new companions longer than he originally anticipated. And with his previously destroyed legs now miraculously healed, he seems bent on re-establishing the Church of Malorn and some other grim task seemingly revealed to him in prayer: to kill Einan the Black, the Mage-Prince of Disparia.</p>

            <image class="character" src="./assets/images/Isho.jpg"></image>
        </div>
        <p>
            <p>Isho hails from the sands beyond the Golden Hills, making him a foreigner among foreigners in the party. A member of a nomadic tribe, he was raised as a Sun Warrior, like his father before him and his grandmother before that. He carries with him a small amount of desert sands, which serves as an oracle for ritual divination, and wields the distinctive yari swordspear of his people. Isho is a stalwart warrior, often rushing to the front of the group to serve as the party’s bulwark. He speaks Common slowly and carefully, unfamiliar as he is with the language, and he often finds the lifestyle of city dwellers confusing, but his strong moral character makes him the heart and conscience of the party.</p>

        </div>
        <p>
            <p>Lem to his companions, this sneaky goblin hails from the Iron Hills. He exhibits an insatiable curiosity and fondness for tinkering with potions and equipment - the more explosive, the better. Sly and perceptive, he gets the party out of trouble almost as quick as he can get them into trouble. The rogue has proven himself particularly convincing and charming when it comes to sniffing out work for the party, and talking his way out of difficult situations, often with an assumed dialect.</p>

        </div>
        <p>
            <p>Rawson Titanwound’s background, before joining the mercenaries of the Bronze Vault of Filia, was as a hunter of beasts. He took a particular speciality in lycanthropy, and therefore styles himself as a Werewolf Hunter. His skills with beasts have already helped the party out of dire situations, as it turns out there are beasts aplenty in Mondial. Generally seeing himself as the voice of reason in the party, his contributions have more often than not gently nudged the party down a safer path.</p>

        </div>
        <p>
            <p>The party knew little of his kind before arriving in Mondial, but Ulrach of the Au’vanwa quickly demonstrated that his kind are trustworthy, serious and capable warriors. His tribe instilled in him a powerful distrust of arcane artifacts and The Art, but with Chain’s End closed and his tribe desperate for resources, he agrees to join the adventurers to investigate the practices of Lundis and The Circle of Illusion within the forests he was taught to avoid for the good of his tribe.</p>

            <h2>Ada Dalton</h2>
        </div>
        <p> 
            <p>The Knights are a clandestine group, often disguised as beggars or servants, more assassins and spies than proper Knights. In times past, the Knights supplemented their skill at arms with magic, but those arts are lost to the modern Knight. Their weapons and attire are designed to hide their status and equipment rather than display it.</p>

<p>When the players met Ada, she was serving Duke Geoffrey undercover as a “tutor” to the Lady Dauphine, his daughter. She is regularly charged with equipping and debriefing the adventurers in their contract work with Marina.</p>

<p>It appears her name was once Abigail, however, since the Knight Simon, stationed in Lundis, asked the party to deliver to “Abigail” a locket bearing her image. She accepted the item without a word from Lem.</p>

Anders hired the party to find and eliminate those responsible for attacks on trade caravans along the East Road towards Balnying. Upon their return, he insists that the mercenaries lie about the cause of the attacks, blaming everything on Disparia. When the party hesitated,he had them imprisoned.</p>

<p>It quickly becomes apparent that he is not who he seems, as the party learns of his involvement in a plot to assassinate the Duke Geoffrey and place blame on Disparians. Before the party could learn more about his motives, they found him ead in the very same cell in which he had imprisoned them. A strange satyr-like creature was standing over him, dressed in green and wiping the blood from his hands.</p>

            <p>The jovial and rotund Duke of Redwater, although he spends more time in Chain’s End dealing with the King and parliament. Still, the people of Redwater love him and call him “The Good Duke Geoffrey, Blessing of the Four Winds upon him!” Shortly after meeting the party (and imprisoning them on the word of his Steward, Anders) Geoffrey was the target of an assassination attempt by unknown forces. Subsequently, he revealed to his adventurous saviors that he was once a member of the Knights of Marina, a clandestine group of warriors in service of the King. Now he has another job for the adventurers: find out who tried to have him killed, and why. And so the party sets off for Lundis and the Great Forest.</p>

<p>Geoffrey himself was a Knight once as well - which explains why the party found his armor still in the attic.</p>
