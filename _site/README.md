# Campaign Diary

I built this website primarily for myself and my players, but I welcome any and all feedback - particularly from fellow developers and fellow DMs!

## For Players
If you're a player, the layout is straightforward: the navbar to the left (at the bottom on mobile) takes you to options for People (including PCs and a list of NPCs you can filter by region), Places (including Regions and "cities") and Items (where you can keep track of all those weird homebrew trick weapons, potions and wearables). There is also an Arcana section with general information your players have gathered on history and religion. I try to be as agnostic as possible about what is true and what is false here - you've heard a great many theories and interpretations of the past, and should take it all with a grain of salt. It may be that no one remains who knows the truth about Mondial's buried past...

## For developers
I designed this site with an eye towards easy navigation. Players in a long-running campaign (we're coming up on a year soon!) have to keep track of a lot of information to stay aware of the world of the game. The DM, meanwhile, needs to be keeping track of how the world shifts and changes around the characters - either because of their actions or independently of them. Without a changing and reactive world, the campaign feels stale, lifeless, waiting to be told what to do. 

After a long time existing as a single static HTML page (which was unwieldy enough that it completely demotivated updates) I migrated the project to Jekyll after encountering the framework in a volunteer project with Code for Chicago. This restructuring makes updating and linking disparate elements, as well as tracking changes over time, much easier. Posts and other data can exist independently of layout. It also cuts down on a lot of unnecessary boilerplate code. 

I threw in some JavaScript here and there to help make filtering certain pieces of info easier where I didn't think Jekyll was the right solution. If you're experienced with Jekyll and think there might be a better way, I'd love to hear from you! You can reach me at albachteng@gmail.com or by commenting anywhere on github.
