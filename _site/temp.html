        <h2>Kingdoms and Cities</h2>

<h3>Marina</h3>

    <p>
        Canonically founded by the Goddess of Storm and Sea Marinal, 
        the people of Marina are a sea-faring sort, although they readily
        admit that they do not venture far from the sight of shore - those who
        do are rarely seen again. Marina's dominance of the waters has led to 
        conflict with Disparia in the past. Regardless, they are an overwhelmingly
        pastoral kingdom, with broad swathes of land dedicated to agriculture. Marina
        was the first and currently only kingdom to make trade with the Goblins for
        their smokepowder weapons.
    </p>

<h4>Chain's End</h4>

    <p>
        The capitol city of the Kingdom of Marina, Chain's End sits over the 
        mouth of the River Llewellyn's Chain ("The Chain"). It is the seat of
        nobility and the largest city in Mondial. Talpa Adamina informs the party
        that it is currently in lock-down due to an unknown plague. 
    </p>

<h4>Redwater</h4>

    <p>
        Sitting at the top of the peninsula known as Marinal's Call, Redwater is ideally situated to observe
        any potential invasions by sea. Even enemy ships seeking to surprise Marina
        from Disparia would have to stick close to shore and would therefore need to
        take a long route around the Call. It is a well-fortified town of modest size. 
        It takes its name from the last war with Disparia, where its walls marked the high-water 
        mark of the Disparian advance. 
    </p>

<h4>Balnying</h4>

    <p>
        "Goblin Town" to those who can't bother to pronounce it. Its name means "Gift of Fire" 
        and it is known as the largest settlement of the otherwise underground-dwelling people 
        called Goblins. It is most-well known for being regularly burnt to the groun by the
        eccentric experiments of its populace, who are devout tinkers. Redwater residents tell
        the party that Knights have been dispatched from Chain's End to keep an eye on the continued
        development of dangerous weaponry. 
    </p>

<h3>Disparia</h3>

    <p>
        Friends to none, the Disparians are known to be militant and fiercely protective. Their
        proximity to the desert leads to regular conflict with the Au'vanwa nomads that dwell there. 
        Disparia invaded Marina in generations past, but Marina held the line, ultimately ceding 
        the Bay of Fire to the Disparian King. 
    </p>

<h4>Malachi's Watch</h4>

    <p>
        
    </p>

<h3>Lundis</h3>

    <p>
        Smallest of the human Kingdoms, the city is protected primarily by its location: deep 
        in the enchanted and beast-filled forests at the center of Mondial, where few dare to 
        travel. Its proximity to The Circle of Illusion has led to the general belief that they 
        are the most sympathetic to the practice of magic. Their major export is a variety of 
        healing potion with a bioluminescent glow. The party learns from Talpa that their Church
        claims to have developed a means of preventing the frenzy that comes with the use of Artifacts.
    </p>

<h4>White Tower</h4>

    <p>
        The mysterious Capitol of Lundis, deep in the illusory forest at the center of Mondial. 
        Seat of the Church of Lundis, at the head of which sits their King. Canonically founded by Malorn, whose Church is the state religion of Lundis. 
    </p>

<h2>Other Locations</h2>

<h3>Au'vanwa</h3>

    <p>The name for both the people and their home-in-exile. The Au'vanwa consider themselves
        not to be natives of Mondial, despite having lived here for generations. They are a group of elves, minotaurs and dragonborn, collectively 
        "Lost and Away." Au'vanwa is hidden away in the desert near the Great Rift, far to the north-east. Their
        people shun the forests for fear of The Voice Within the Trees that calls them back to The Weald, where they believe 
        the Raven King would seek to control them once more.</p>

<h3>The Circle of Illusion</h3>

        <p>Across the River Llewellyn's Chain, in the great forests at Mondial's center, is a loose 
            confederacy of Mages. Spurned from the human kingdoms for their magical talents, the mages ban together
            for safety. Ora tells the party that it is a terrible place that brought more questions than answers. 
            Of course, nothing in the Circle of Illusion is what it seems. Who knows to what ends they practice their charms?
        </p>

<h3>The School of Talen</h3>

        <p>
            Known only to the Outlanders as a place of study, it is a Lundisian operation by the sea far to the west. 
            The Scholars seek to uncover the truth about the Artifacts - and their use.
