    <h1>Religion</h1>
    <p>The human kingdoms have a shared patheon, but disagree on who sits at its peak. There are also deviations in their mythologies. Some of these disagreements are detailed below. Other races have gods and pantheons of their own, and most religions tell stories of the wars between the gods, which continue today.</p>
    
    

    <h2>Name Unknown</h2>
    <h3>The Horned Queen of The Weald<br>Domain: Nature</h3>
    <p><p>The Au’vanwa still hold The Horned Queen in their hearts, said to be the original god of The Weald. She is credited with the creation of dragons, minotaurs and dragonborn. Au’vanwa legends say that she gave birth to her own husband, the Raven King, who now rules in her stead. No known depictions of her exist, and while the desert nomads hold her in high esteem, they do not worship her.</p>
</p>



    <h2>Name Unknown</h2>
    <h3>The Serenely Smiling Sun of The Deep Roads<br>Domain: </h3>
    <p><p>The adventurers have seen depictions of this unnamed god in the Circle of Illusion, the Great Forest and in the Deep Roads, frequently accompanied by sacrificial offerings. It is a figure shaped like a man but buried under robes. Its face is covered by a mask fashioned in the likeness of a serenely smiling sun. Hubert discovered that the form underneath the robes is not human - it is something misshapen.</p>
</p>



    <h2>Llewellyn</h2>
    <h3>The Mountain of Cloudstone<br>Domain: Life</h3>
    <p><p>Rarely seen outside of Cloudstone or the Deep Roads, Llewellyn is depicted as a Chained Giant without a face. He holds a chisel and hammer, but restrained as he is it seems unlikely he could make use of it. Rawson found a particular affinity for the depictions he found of this patient behemoth. His name can be found in the name of the largest river in Mondial: the river <em>Llewellyn’s Chain</em>, from which Chain’s End also receives its name.</p>
</p>



    <h2>Lucius</h2>
    <h3>The Imp of The Deep Roads<br>Domain: Trickery</h3>
    <p><p>The favored god of the Goblins of The Deep Roads, the God of Trickery is depicted as a masked imp, its visage at once laughing and weeping.</p>
</p>



    <h2>Malachi</h2>
    <h3>The Chessmaster of Disparia<br>Domain: War</h3>
    <p><p>The Au’vanwa say that in the Disparian religion, one does not pray: one studies. The bylaw of worshippers of Malachi is “whatever is necessary.” Before he ascended to the godhead, Malachi was a legendary swordsman, wielding an equally legendary silvery greatsword, which he is frequently depicted holding point down before him. But perhaps his greater accomplishment in life was his reputation for winning battles and armies without ever raising his blade. In Disparia, the highest military rank is not General, but Grandmaster. In Malachi, Disparians have a dispassionate and calculating model for war - a tactician, not a beserker.</p>
</p>



    <h2>Malorn</h2>
    <h3>The Despised of Lundis<br>Domain: Death</h3>
    <p><p>The Church of Malorn worships Death and The Moon, said to be His Great Eye, watching over the world. The mythology of Malorn places him as hero to all of humanity, and the first human mage. Stories say that he was born a mortal man, disfigured from birth. His father, an ancient warlord, rejected him for his misshapen figure and dropped him from a tall, pale tower to his death. Malorn lay dead for a time but rose to seek out The Weald, which had enticed him with the beautiful glow of its twilight. 
<br /><br />
Malorn lived long among the Fae and learnt their magic, but he knew he did not belong. The Fae were intrigued by Malorn himself, but repulsed by what they found when they sought out other humans. The light of human souls were hideous in the eyes of the twilight races, and they determined to snuff it out. 
<br /><br />
Malorn convinced the Fae to allow him to return to Mondial. He promised that if they let him borrow their magic, he would make it so that the light of humanity that they found so offensive would never cross their borders again. It is unknown what exactly he did with that magic, but it has ripped Mondial and The Weald apart and set an uncrossable barrier between them.</p>
</p>



    <h2>Marinal</h2>
    <h3>The Dancer of Marina<br>Domain: </h3>
    <p><p>The Marinese worship Marina, their canonical founder. She is known to them as Our Lady of Storm and Sea. Her child is identified only as “The Moon”, who she is said to have sacrificed to hold the oceans at bay. Her worshp also seems to be related to the four winds: Borean, Eureon, Notheon, Zephyron. Place names in Marina frequently reference these winds as lesser deities.
<br /><br />Marina is lord of the limitless sea, and is believed to hold domain over the rains and waters aross Mondial as well. She is sometimes portrayed as a mother, but her primary role in the pantheon is as a warrior. She is also called “Marinal the Dancer”; the moniker is ironic and refers to her legendaryily wild performance on the battlefields during the War of Lights, the mythical war of Mondial’s creation.
<br /><br />While Malorn and Malachi are professed to have been born mortal and ascended to the godhead, Marinal is said to have always been master of her domain. She is said to have the power to wash this world away.</p>
</p>



    <h2>Name Unknown</h2>
    <h3>The Raven King of The Weald<br>Domain: Knowledge</h3>
    <p><p>In Mondial, it is considered terrible luck to see a Raven. He is credited with the creation of elves and ruler of The Weald. When the Raven King spreads his dark wings they block out the light of the sun and he can see everywhere at once. Among the human kingdoms, he is more myth than god, a story used to frighten children into obedience. But the Au’vanwa consider him a mad tyrant, usurper of the Horned Queen.</p>
